ABSTRACT
We present a simple yet effective approach that can transform the OpenAI GPT-3.5
model into a reliable motion planner for autonomous vehicles. Motion planning is
a core challenge in autonomous driving, aiming to plan a driving trajectory that is
safe and comfortable. Existing motion planners predominantly leverage heuristic
methods to forecast driving trajectories, yet these approaches demonstrate insuffi-
cient generalization capabilities in the face of novel and unseen driving scenarios.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach to motion planning that capitalizes
on the strong reasoning capabilities and generalization potential inherent to Large
Language Models (LLMs). The fundamental insight of our approach is the refor-
mulation of motion planning as a language modeling problem, a perspective not
previously explored. Specifically, we represent the planner inputs and outputs as
language tokens, and leverage the LLM to generate driving trajectories through
a language description of coordinate positions. Furthermore, we propose a novel
prompting-reasoning-finetuning strategy to stimulate the numerical reasoning po-
tential of the LLM. With this strategy, the LLM can describe highly precise trajec-
tory coordinates and also its internal decision-making process in natural language.
We evaluate our approach on the large-scale nuScenes dataset, and extensive ex-
periments substantiate the effectiveness, generalization ability, and interpretability
of our GPT-based motion planner. Code is now available here.

INTRODUCTION
Autonomous driving stands as one of the most ambitious and challenging frontiers in modern tech-
nology, aiming to revolutionize transportation systems globally. Central to this endeavor is the con-
cept of motion planning, a cornerstone in autonomous driving technology that seeks to devise safe
and comfortable driving trajectories for autonomous vehicles. The intricacies of motion planning
arise from its need to accommodate diverse driving scenarios and make reasonable driving decisions.
As autonomous vehicles interact with various environments and unpredictable human drivers, the
robustness and explainability of motion planners become essential for driving safety and reliability.
Existing motion planning approaches generally fall into two categories. The rule-based methods
(Treiber et al., 2000; Thrun et al., 2006; Bacha et al., 2008; Leonard et al., 2008; Urmson et al., 2008;
Chen et al., 2015; Sauer et al., 2018; Fan et al., 2018) designed explicit rules to determine driving
trajectories. These methods have clear interpretability but generally fail to handle extreme driving
scenarios that are not covered by rules. Alternatively, the learning-based approaches (Bojarski et al.,
2016; Codevilla et al., 2018; 2019; Rhinehart et al., 2019; Zeng et al., 2019; Sadat et al., 2020; Casas
et al., 2021; Hu et al., 2022; 2023; Dauner et al., 2023) resorted to a data-driven strategy and learned
their models from large-scale human driving trajectories. While exhibiting good performance, these
approaches sacrifice interpretability by viewing motion planning as a black-box forecasting problem.
Essentially, both prevailing rule-based and learning-based approaches are devoid of the common
sense reasoning ability innate to human drivers, which restricts their capabilities in tackling long-
tailed driving scenarios.
Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022;
OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023a;b) have demonstrated great generalization power and common
sense reasoning ability emerged from these language models, indicating their potential in addressing
problems in the realm of autonomous driving. An important question naturally arises: How can we
leverage LLMs to resolve the motion planning problem? The major challenge is that motion planners
are required to process heterogeneous inputs, e.g., ego-vehicle information, maps, and perception

results, and they need to predict high-precision waypoint coordinates that represent a future driving
trajectory. While LLMs excel at language understanding, they cannot directly handle heterogeneous
data. Moreover, it is yet to be established whether LLMs are capable of precise numerical reasoning,
e.g. forecasting precise coordinate values that are demanded by motion planning.
To this end, we propose a novel approach that successfully unleashes the power of LLMs to address
the motion planning problem in autonomous driving. The critical insight is that we can reformulate
motion planning as a language modeling problem. Specifically, we propose to tackle the heteroge-
neous planner inputs by transforming them into unified language tokens, and we instruct a GPT-3.5
model to understand these tokens and then articulate the waypoint coordinates of a future driving tra-
jectory through natural language description. We further elucidate the essence of language modeling
in motion planning from the perspective of tokenizers. Moreover, to stimulate the numerical reason-
ing potential of GPT-3.5, we propose a prompting-reasoning-finetuning strategy, where GPT-3.5 is
initially prompted in the context of autonomous driving, and then performs chain-of-thought reason-
ing to generate sensible outputs, and finally the model is fine-tuned with human driving trajectories
to ensure alignments with human driving behaviors. With this strategy, GPT-3.5 is able to fore-
cast highly precise waypoint coordinates with only a centimeter-level error. The chain-of-thought
reasoning further enhances transparency in decision-making and makes our approach more inter-
pretable than other learning-based methods. Benefiting from the state-of-the-art GPT-3.5 model,
our approach also exhibits good generalization and common sense reasoning ability.
We summarize our contributions as follows:
· We propose GPT-Driver, a GPT-based motion planner, innovatively transforming the motion plan-
ning task into a language modeling problem. We also provide an intuitive interpretation of language
modeling in motion planning through the lens of the GPT tokenizer.
· We propose a novel prompting-reasoning-finetuning strategy in the context of autonomous driving,
which enables precise numerical reasoning and transparent decision-making of our approach.
· Our GPT-Driver demonstrates superior motion planning performance, few-shot generalization abil-
ity, and interpretability compared to the state-of-the-art motion planners on the nuScenes dataset.

RELATED WORKS
Motion planning in autonomous driving. Motion planning aims to forecast safe and comfortable
driving routes for autonomous vehicles. Existing approaches can be divided into three categories:
rule-based, optimization-based, and learning-based methods. The rule-based approaches (Treiber
et al., 2000; Thrun et al., 2006; Bacha et al., 2008; Leonard et al., 2008; Urmson et al., 2008; Chen
et al., 2015; Sauer et al., 2018; Fan et al., 2018; Dauner et al., 2023) resort to pre-defined rules
to determine future driving trajectories. Intelligent Driver Model (Treiber et al., 2000) (IDM) is a
seminal work that proposed a heuristic motion model to follow a leading vehicle in traffic while
maintaining a safe distance. Despite being simple and interpretable, IDM lacks sufficient capability
to handle complicated driving behaviors such as U-turns. The optimization-based approaches (Li
et al., 2022; Liniger et al., 2015; Scheffe et al., 2022) formulate motion planning as an optimal
control problem. In contrast, the learning-based approaches (Bojarski et al., 2016; Codevilla et al.,
2018; 2019; Rhinehart et al., 2019; Zeng et al., 2019; Sadat et al., 2020; Casas et al., 2021; Hu et al.,
2022; 2023) proposed to handle complex driving scenarios by learning from large-scale human
driving data. Neural motion planner (Zeng et al., 2019) suggested using a learned cost volume to
assess each feasible driving trajectory. P3 (Sadat et al., 2020), MP3 (Casas et al., 2021), ST-P3 (Hu
et al., 2022), and UniAD (Hu et al., 2023) proposed end-to-end learning of planning and other tasks
in autonomous driving. These approaches rely on deep neural networks, while the decision-making
process is implicitly encoded in neural networks and thus less interpretable.
Our GPT-Driver is a learning-based motion planner. In contrast to other learning-based approaches,
we leverage the generalization and reasoning ability of the GPT-3.5 model, which enables our model
to tackle those long-tailed driving scenarios that are generally challenging to other methods. Our
method also has better interpretability thanks to the novel prompting-reasoning-finetuning strategy.

ties in natural language processing. GPT (Brown et al., 2020) is a pioneering work that proposed
the Generative Pre-trained Transformer to tackle language understanding and generation problems.
The following versions GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) demonstrated impressive chatting and
reasoning ability. LLaMA and LLaMA 2 (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) are open-source foundation
language models. To better harness the capabilities of LLMs, InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022)
proposed to train LLMs to follow instructions with human feedback. (Wei et al., 2022) proposed
chain-of-thought prompting to enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs. ReAct (Yao et al., 2022)
exploited the synergy of reasoning and acting in LLMs. These methods have bolstered the language
understanding and decision-making capabilities of LLMs. Despite the success of LLMs in language
understanding, exploiting the power of LLMs in autonomous driving remains an open challenge, as
the inputs and outputs of autonomous systems are not language. In this paper, we tackle this chal-
lenge by reformulating the traditional driving problem into a language modeling problem. Moreover,
we propose a novel prompting-reasoning-finetuning strategy tailored for autonomous driving, which
is significantly different from the existing works (Yao et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022) and amplifies
the reasoning capabilities of the LLM-based planner.
There is also a series of works (Ahn et al., 2022; Fu et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2022; Song et al.,
2022) using LLMs for task-level planning, i.e., planning high-level actions for embodied agents. In
contrast, our method focuses on motion planning, i.e. planning waypoint-based low-level driving
trajectories for autonomous vehicles. Unlike the natural language descriptions used for high-level
actions, trajectories are represented as sets of numerical coordinates, posing a greater challenge for
LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to demonstrate GPT-3.5’s capability for
detailed numerical reasoning in motion planning.

GPT-DRIVER
In this section, we present GPT-Driver, an LLM-based motion planner for autonomous driving.
An overview of our GPT-Driver is shown in Figure 1. We first introduce the basic concept and
problem definition of motion planning in the context of autonomous driving (Section 3.1). Then,
we demonstrate how to reformulate motion planning as a language modeling problem (Section 3.2).
Finally, we introduce how to address this language modeling problem using a novel prompting-
reasoning-finetuning strategy (Section 3.3).
3.1
PROBLEM DEFINITION
The objective of motion planning in autonomous driving is to plan a safe and comfortable driving
trajectory T with observations O and ego-states S as input. The motion planning process F can be
formulated as:
T = F(O, S).
(1)
3

<!-- Page 4 -->
Foundation Models for Decision Making Workshop at NeurIPS 2023
A planned trajectory T can be represented as a set of waypoints of t timesteps: T ∈Rt×2:
T = {(x1, y1), · · · , (xt, yt)},
(2)
where (xi, yi) is a 2D waypoint coordinate that denotes the vehicle’s anticipated location at the
timestep i. The ego-states S generally consist of a historical trajectory of this vehicle and its current
status such as velocity and acceleration. The observations O contain the outputs of perception and
prediction systems, e.g., detected object bounding boxes and their future motions.
The learning-based motion planners generally learn the trajectory T by imitating a human driver’s
driving trajectory ˆT with L1 regression, where the loss function Lreg can be formulated as:
Lreg =
T
X
i=1
(|xi −ˆxi| + |yi −ˆyi|),
(3)
where (xi, yi) and (ˆxi, ˆyi) are waypoints of the planned trajectory T and the human trajectory T ′
respectively. Albeit simple, these approaches attempt to simultaneously regress waypoints across
different scales, e.g. coordinate values ranging from 0 to over 50, which generally results in impre-
cise coordinate estimations of the more distant waypoints. To this end, we propose a novel approach
that supplants the traditional L1 trajectory regression with a language modeling framework.
3.2
MOTION PLANNING AS LANGUAGE MODELING
The crucial insight of this paper is to transform motion planning into a language modeling problem.
Given a driving trajectory T , we can represent it as a sequence of words that describe this trajectory:
T = K({(x1, y1), · · · , (xt, yt)}) = {w1, · · · , wn},
(4)
where wi is the i-th word in this sequence. Please note that each coordinate value x or y in Equation
2 can be freely transformed into a set of words {w} using a language tokenizer K. For instance, a
coordinate value 23.17 can be transformed into three words: “23”, “.”, and “17” using the GPT-3.5
tokenizer. With this language representation, we can then reformulate the motion planning problem
as a language modeling problem:
LLM = −
N
X
i=1
log P( ˆwi|w1, · · · , wi−1),
(5)
where w and ˆw are the words from the planned trajectory T and the human driving trajectory ˆT
respectively. By learning to maximize the occurrence probability P of the words ˆw derived from the
human driving trajectory ˆT , motion planners can generate human-like driving trajectories.
We can derive a natural interpretation of how language modeling works in motion planning through
the lens of tokenization. Take the coordinate value 23.17 as an example. Through tokenization, it is
decomposed into “23” which is the integer part of this value, “.”, and “17” which is the decimal part
of this value. Hence, the process of predicting this waypoint coordinate is essentially first estimating
a coarse location at the meter level (“23” here) and then estimating a fine-grained location at the
centimeter level (“17” here). Moreover, the estimations are established by classifications of the
correct tokens in the vocabulary, rather than regression of their absolute values.
We note that language modeling has been employed in other tasks of computer vision and robotics,
such as object detection (Chen et al., 2021; Xue et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023) and robotic control
(Brohan et al., 2023). However, these approaches heavily rely on specially designed tokens and to-
kenizers, which makes their methods less intuitive and hard to generalize to other tasks. In contrast,
our key observation is that a commonly used language tokenizer such as the GPT tokenizer already
has sufficient capability to estimate very precise numerical values for motion planning. This unique
finding makes our approach significantly simpler than prior methods, and also makes our approach
more generalizable and compatible with natural language.

PROMPTING-REASONING-FINETUNING
Despite the potential of language modeling in motion planning, simply adopting (Wei et al., 2022;
Ouyang et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2022) and prompting GPT-3.5 to generate trajectories didn’t work
in practice (See Section 4.5). To this end, we introduce a novel prompting-reasoning-finetuning
strategy that stimulates the potential of language modeling to address the motion planning problem.
Specifically, we introduce a method that utilizes the GPT tokenizer K to convert observations O and
ego-states S into language prompts. These prompts are then fed into the GPT-3.5 model FGP T . We
instruct the model to articulate its decision-making process explicitly and produce planned trajecto-
ries T in natural language. Finally, we fine-tune the GPT model’s outputs to ensure alignment with
human driving trajectories. The prompting-reasoning-finetuning process can be formulated as
{T , R} = FGP T (K(O, S)),
(6)
where T = {w1, · · · , wn} is a language description of the trajectory in Equation 4, and R denotes
a language description of the chain-of-thought reasoning and decision-making process. In contrast
to the traditional motion planning methods that solely generate planned trajectories, our approach
generates both the trajectories T and the explicit reasoning process R, which makes our model’s
decision-making process more transparent. Hence, our approach demonstrates better interpretability
than the existing methods.
In subsequent sections, we delve into details of the prompting, reasoning, and fine-tuning process.

designed to handle language inputs. To overcome the above limitations, we resort to the parame-
terized representations of observations and ego-states and convert them into language descriptions.
In particular, we utilize detected objects that are parameterized by their class names and locations
as perception results. For each object, we formulate a sentence capturing these attributes. These
sentences collectively form the perception prompts. Similarly, we can craft prediction prompts by
converting the parameterized future trajectories of detected objects into natural language descrip-
tions. We can also generate the prompts for ego-states by articulating the ego vehicle’s current
status such as velocity and heading. Furthermore, we provide general context information about
motion planning, such as the coordinate system, objective, etc. Finally, we rephrase these prompts
in a more concise format using ChatGPT-4 and utilize them as the inputs to the GPT-3.5 model. An
example of prompts is shown in Figure 2.
Reasoning. A common weakness of current motion planners is their limited interpretability, since
these planners generate planned trajectories from black-box neural networks without elucidating the
reasoning behind their decisions. To address this problem, we propose a novel chain-of-thought
reasoning strategy specifically designed for autonomous driving. In particular, we summarize the
chain-of-thought reasoning process in autonomous driving into 3 steps: First, from the perception
results, the motion planner needs to identify those critical objects that may affect its driving dynam-
ics. Second, by analyzing the future motions of these critical objects from the prediction results, the
planner should infer when, where, and how this critical object may influence the ego vehicle. Third,
on top of the insights gained from the previous analyses, the planner needs to draw a high-level
driving decision and then convert it into a planned trajectory. This three-step reasoning framework
offers a more structured approach to motion planning and ensures greater transparency throughout
the planning procedure. An example is shown in Figure 3.
Fine-tuning. To align the LLM’s outputs with human driving behaviors, we employ a simple fine-
tuning strategy using the OpenAI fine-tuning API. Specifically, we collect human driving trajectories
ˆT for each scenario from driving logs. To generate the ground truth guidance of chain-of-thought
reasoning ˆR, we initially compute a hypothetical ego-trajectory based on the current velocity and
acceleration of the ego vehicle, assuming there is no interference. Then, we identify the critical
objects and their potential effects by examining if any objects, based on their present positions
and predicted future paths, overlap with the hypothetical ego-trajectory. We found this strategy
works well in practice, enabling us to bypass the tedious task of manually annotating the reasoning
process. Finally, we can fine-tune the LLM’s outputs {T , R} with the ground truth { ˆT , ˆR} using the
language modeling loss LLM defined in Equation 5. During inference, we transform the language
output of a planned trajectory back to its numerical format for evaluation.

EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we demonstrate the effectiveness, generalization ability, and interpretability of our
GPT-Driver through extensive experiments on the large-scale and real-world nuScenes dataset (Cae-
sar et al., 2020). We first introduce the experimental settings and evaluation metrics, and then com-
pare our approach against state-of-the-art motion planning methods on the nuScenes dataset. Finally,
we conduct studies to evaluate the generalization and interpretability of our approach.

Table 1: Motion planning performance. Our approach significantly outperforms prior works by a
large margin in L2 and performs on par with the top methods in collision rate.
4.1
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
The nuScenes dataset is a large-scale and real-world autonomous driving dataset. It contains 1000
driving scenarios and approximately 40000 key frames encompassing a diverse range of locations
and weather conditions. We follow the general practice in prior works (Hu et al., 2022; 2023; Jiang
et al., 2023) and split the whole dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. We use the training
set to fine-tune our model and evaluate our model’s performance on the validation set, which ensures
a fair comparison with prior works.
For a fair comparison with other methods, we adopt the evaluation metrics in UniAD (Hu et al.,
2023) to evaluate our planned trajectories. It contains two metrics: L2 error (in meters) and collision
rate (in percentage). The average L2 error is computed by measuring each waypoint’s distance in
the planned and ground-truth trajectories. It reflects the proximity of a planned trajectory to a human
driving trajectory. The collision rate is computed by placing an ego-vehicle box on each waypoint
of the planned trajectory and then checking for collisions with the ground truth bounding boxes
of other objects. It reflects the safety of a planned trajectory. We follow the common practice in
previous works and evaluate the motion planning result in the 3-second time horizon.
4.2
COMPARISON AGAINST THE STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS
End-to-end driving approaches like UniAD (Hu et al., 2023) perform motion planning based on their
internal perception and prediction outputs. For a fair comparison with this work, we build our model
on top of the perception and prediction results from their model.
Table 1 shows the motion planning performance of our GPT-Driver against the state-of-the-art meth-
ods. It is clear that our GPT-Driver significantly outperforms the prior works in the L2 metric by
a large margin, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in generating human-like driving
trajectories. L2 is a strong indicator of the imitation learning ability of motion planners. Our ap-
proach surpasses the state-of-the-art approaches in L2, indicating that the fine-tuned LLM has a
stronger imitation learning ability compared to MLP-based planners. The collision rate serves as a
strong indicator of the safety of motion planning. Our approach also aligns closely with the state-
of-the-art methods in the collision metric, indicating our capability to plan safe driving trajectories.
Please note that other baseline methods heavily rely on tricks such as post-optimization to lower
the collision rate. By contrast, our approach doesn’t rely on these tricks. It is worth noting that
these state-of-the-art planners (Hu et al., 2023) heavily rely on dense occupancy grids and maps, in
addition to detection and prediction, which makes their systems intricate and time-consuming. In
contrast, our approach only takes language descriptions of detections and predictions as input obser-
vations, which is much simpler than prior methods. Our method also has the potential to incorporate
vectorized maps to further boost the performance.
4.3
FEW-SHOT MOTION PLANNING
To further validate the generalization ability of our GPT-Driver, we designed a few-shot motion
planning experiment. Specifically, we sampled 1%, 10%, 50% of the training scenarios and utilized

them for fine-tuning our model and training the state-of-the-art motion planner in UniAD. For a fair
comparison, both UniAD and our approach leverage the same pretrained detection and prediction
modules as inputs, and all other parameters remain the same. Table 2 illustrates the few-shot motion
planning results. Our approach attains decent motion planning results on the validation set when
exposed to only 10% of the full training scenarios, while UniAD failed to obtain good performance
when the training data is limited. In contrast to other learning-based planners that heavily rely on
large amounts of data, our GPT-Driver fine-tuned on a few training scenarios could generalize well
to the full validation set, which indicates its strong generalization and few-shot learning ability.
4.4
INTERPRETABILITY
To demonstrate the interpretability of our GPT-Driver, we visualized the reasoning outputs and the
planned trajectories of our model in Figure 4. From the figure, we can observe that our method is
able to identify critical objects and assess their potential effects from all perception and prediction
inputs, and then based on these observations it can generate a coherent high-level action as well as
a sensible driving trajectory. For example, in the first sub-figure, our GPT-Driver could identify all
obstacles such as barriers and traffic cones, and further neglect the far-away white bus that has no
effect on our driving route. Then it can generate a turn-right action with a deceleration to avoid
collisions with these obstacles. Finally, it plans a smooth and safe turning trajectory. In contrast
to previous methods that only generate planned trajectories, our approach generates not only the
trajectories but also the reasoning process of how it predicts these trajectories. Thus our approach
can demonstrate better interpretability.
4.5
FINE-TUNING VS. IN-CONTEXT LEARNING
In-context learning and fine-tuning are two prevalent strategies to instruct an LLM for specific tasks.
While our fine-tuning strategy works well in motion planning, it raises the question of whether in-
context learning could achieve comparable results in this task. To answer this question, we designed
an in-context learning experiment where we used both the inputs and the expected outputs in the
training set as new exemplar inputs to instruct the LLM. The results in Table 3 suggest that fine-
tuning performs significantly better than in-context learning. This is mainly because the model’s
context window is quite limited in in-context learning, e.g. GPT-3.5 can accommodate a maximum
of only 5 exemplar inputs every time in our case. Hence, our fine-tuning strategy is indispensable.
4.6
LIMITATIONS
Due to the limitations of the OpenAI APIs, we are unable to obtain the inference time of our model.
Thus it remains uncertain whether our approach can meet the real-time demands of commercial driv-
ing applications. Typically, the GPT-based planner would exhibit a longer inference time compared

to existing MLP-based planners. Nevertheless, we argue that there are many techniques that could
resolve this problem, e.g. distilling a smaller LLM, etc. We leave this for future work.
Another limitation lies in the evaluation of motion planning. As open-loop motion planning doesn’t
fully emulate error accumulation in the driving process, recently close-loop motion planning has
become increasingly popular to evaluate the performances of motion planners. We leave close-loop
motion planning of our GPT-Driver for future work.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we introduce GPT-Driver, an innovative method that transforms the OpenAI GPT-3.5
model into a dependable motion planner for autonomous driving. We reformulate motion planning
as a language modeling problem, and we propose a novel prompting-reasoning-finetuning strategy to
tackle this problem. Through extensive experiments on the large-scale autonomous driving dataset,
our approach has demonstrated superior planning performance, generalization, and interpretability
compared to existing works. Future works include optimizing the inference time and involving more
sensor observations such as high-definition maps in input prompts.
