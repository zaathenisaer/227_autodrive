Abstract
Autonomous driving is a multi-agent setting where the host vehicle must apply
sophisticated negotiation skills with other road users when overtaking, giving way,
merging, taking left and right turns and while pushing ahead in unstructured urban
roadways. Since there are many possible scenarios, manually tackling all possible
cases will likely yield a too simplistic policy. Moreover, one must balance between
unexpected behavior of other drivers/pedestrians and at the same time not to be too
defensive so that normal trafﬁc ﬂow is maintained.
In this paper we apply deep reinforcement learning to the problem of forming
long term driving strategies. We note that there are two major challenges that
make autonomous driving different from other robotic tasks. First, is the necessity
for ensuring functional safety — something that machine learning has difﬁculty
with given that performance is optimized at the level of an expectation over many
instances. Second, the Markov Decision Process model often used in robotics is
problematic in our case because of unpredictable behavior of other agents in this
multi-agent scenario. We make three contributions in our work. First, we show how
policy gradient iterations can be used, and the variance of the gradient estimation
using stochastic gradient ascent can be minimized, without Markovian assumptions.
Second, we decompose the problem into a composition of a Policy for Desires
(which is to be learned) and trajectory planning with hard constraints (which is
not learned). The goal of Desires is to enable comfort of driving, while hard
constraints guarantees the safety of driving. Third, we introduce a hierarchical
temporal abstraction we call an “Option Graph” with a gating mechanism that
signiﬁcantly reduces the effective horizon and thereby reducing the variance of
the gradient estimation even further. The Option Graph plays a similar role to
“structured prediction” in supervised learning, thereby reducing sample complexity,
while also playing a similar role to LSTM gating mechanisms used in supervised
deep networks.

Introduction
Endowing a robotic car with the ability to form long term driving strategies, referred to as “Driving
Policy”, is key for enabling fully autonomous driving. The process of sensing , i.e., the process of
forming an environmental model consisting of location of all moving and stationary objects, the
position and type of path delimiters (such as curbs, barriers, and so forth), all drivable paths with
their semantic meaning and all trafﬁc signs and trafﬁc lights around the car — is well deﬁned. While
sensing is well understood, the deﬁnition of Driving Policy, its underlying assumptions, and its
functional breakdown is less understood. The extent of the challenge to form driving strategies that
mimic human drivers is underscored by the ﬂurry of media reports on the simplistic driving policies
exhibited by current autonomous test vehicles by various practitioners (e.g. [23]). In order to support
autonomous capabilities a robotic driven vehicle should adopt human driving negotiation skills when
overtaking, giving way, merging, taking left and right turns and while pushing ahead in unstructured
urban roadways. Since there are many possible scenarios, manually tackling all possible cases will

likely yield a too simplistic policy. Moreover, one must balance between unexpected behavior of
other drivers/pedestrians and at the same time not to be too defensive so that normal trafﬁc ﬂow is
maintained.
These challenges naturally suggest using machine learning approaches. Traditionally, machine
learning approaches for planning strategies are studied under the framework of Reinforcement
Learning (RL) — see [6, 17, 31, 35] for a general overview and [19] for a comprehensive review of
reinforcement learning in robotics. Using machine learning, and speciﬁcally RL, raises two concerns
which we address in this paper. The ﬁrst is about ensuring functional safety of the Driving Policy —
something that machine learning has difﬁculty with given that performance is optimized at the level
of an expectation over many instances. Namely, given the very low probability of an accident the
only way to guarantee safety is by scaling up the variance of the parameters to be estimated and the
sample complexity of the learning problem — to a degree which becomes unwieldy to solve. Second,
the Markov Decision Process model often used in robotics is problematic in our case because of
unpredictable behavior of other agents in this multi-agent scenario.
Before explaining our approach for tackling these difﬁculties, we brieﬂy describe the key idea behind
most common reinforcement learning algorithms. Typically, RL is performed in a sequence of
consecutive rounds. At round t, the agent (a.k.a planner) observes a state, st ∈S, which represents
the sensing state of the system, i.e., the environmental model as mentioned above. It then should
decide on an action at ∈A. After performing the action, the agent receives an immediate reward,
rt ∈R, and is moved to a new state, st+1. The goal of the planner is to maximize the cumulative
reward (maybe up to a time horizon or a discounted sum of future rewards). To do so, the planner
relies on a policy, π : S →A, which maps a state into an action.
Most of the RL algorithms rely in some way or another on the mathematically elegant model of
a Markov Decision Process (MDP), pioneered by the work of Bellman [4, 5]. The Markovian
assumption is that the distribution of st+1 is fully determined given st and at. This yields a closed
form expression for the cumulative reward of a given policy in terms of the stationary distribution
over states of the MDP. The stationary distribution of a policy can be expressed as a solution to a
linear programming problem. This yields two families of algorithms: optimizing with respect to the
primal problem, which is called policy search, and optimizing with respect to the dual problem, whose
variables are called the value function, V π. The value function determines the expected cumulative
reward if we start the MDP from the initial state s, and from there on pick actions according to π. A
related quantity is the state-action value function, Qπ(s, a), which determines the cumulative reward
if we start from state s, immediately pick action a, and from there on pick actions according to π. The
Q function gives rise to a crisp characterization of the optimal policy (using the so called Bellman’s
equation), and in particular it shows that the optimal policy is a deterministic function from S to A
(in fact, it is the greedy policy with respect to the optimal Q function).
In a sense, the key advantage of the MDP model is that it allows us to couple all the future into the
present using the Q function. That is, given that we are now in state s, the value of Qπ(s, a) tells
us the effect of performing action a at the moment on the entire future. Therefore, the Q function
gives us a local measure of the quality of an action a, thus making the RL problem more similar to
supervised learning.
Most reinforcement learning algorithms approximate the V function or the Q function in one way
or another. Value iteration algorithms, e.g. the Q learning algorithm [40], relies on the fact that the
V and Q functions of the optimal policy are ﬁxed points of some operators derived from Bellman’s
equation. Actor-critic policy iteration algorithms aim to learn a policy in an iterative way, where at
iteration t, the “critic” estimates Qπt and based on this, the “actor” improves the policy.
Despite the mathematical elegancy of MDPs and the conveniency of switching to the Q function
representation, there are several limitations of this approach. First, as noted in [19], usually in robotics,
we may only be able to ﬁnd some approximate notion of a Markovian behaving state. Furthermore,
the transition of states depends not only on the agent’s action, but also on actions of other players
in the environment. For example, in the context of autonomous driving, while the dynamic of the
autonomous vehicle is clearly Markovian, the next state depends on the behavior of the other road
users (vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists), which is not necessarily Markovian. One possible solution
to this problem is to use partially observed MDPs [41], in which we still assume that there is a
Markovian state, but we only get to see an observation that is distributed according to the hidden
state. A more direct approach considers game theoretical generalizations of MDPs, for example
2

the Stochastic Games framework. Indeed, some of the algorithms for MDPs were generalized to
multi-agents games. For example, the minimax-Q learning [20] or the Nash-Q learning [15]. Other
approaches to Stochastic Games are explicit modeling of the other players, that goes back to Brown’s
ﬁctitious play [9], and vanishing regret learning algorithms [13, 10]. See also [39, 38, 18, 8]. As
noted in [30], learning in multi-agent setting is inherently more complex than in the single agent
setting. Taken together, in the context of autonomous driving, given the unpredictable behavior of
other road users, the MDP framework and its extensions are problematic in the least and could yield
impractical RL algorithms.
When it comes to categories of RL algorithms and how they handle the Markov assumption, we can
divide them into four groups:
• Algorithms that estimate the Value or Q function – those clearly are deﬁned solely in the context of
MDP.
• Policy based learning methods where, for example, the gradient of the policy π is estimated using
the likelihood ratio trick (cf. [2, 32, 25]) and thereby the learning of π is an iterative process where
at each iteration the agent interacts with the environment while acting based on the current Policy
estimation. Policy gradient methods are derived using the Markov assumption, but we will see later
that this is not necessarily required.
• Algorithms that learn the dynamics of the process, namely, the function that takes (st, at) and yields
a distribution over the next state st+1. Those are known as Model-based methods, and those clearly
rely on the Markov assumption.
• Behavior cloning (Imitation) methods. The Imitation approach simply requires a training set of
examples of the form (st, at), where at is the action of the human driver (cf. [7]). One can then
use supervised learning to learn a policy π such that π(st) ≈at. Clearly there is no Markov
assumption involved in the process. The problem with Imitation is that different human drivers, and
even the same human, are not deterministic in their policy choices. Hence, learning a function for
which ∥π(st) −at∥is very small is often infeasible. And, once we have small errors, they might
accumulate over time and yield large errors.
Our ﬁrst observation (detailed in sec. 2) is that Policy Gradient does not really require the Markov
assumption and furthermore that some methods for reducing the variance of the gradient estimator
(cf. [26]) would not require Markov assumptions as well. Taken together, the RL algorithm could be
initialized through Imitation and then updated using an iterative Policy Gradient approach without
the Markov assumption.
The second contribution of the paper is a method for guaranteeing functional safety of the Driving
Policy outcome. Given the very small probability p ≪1 of an accident, the corresponding reward of
a trajectory leading to an accident should be much smaller than −1/p, thus generating a very high
variance of the gradient estimator (see Lemma 3). Regardless of the means of reducing variance, as
detailed in sec. 2, the variance of the gradient not only depends on the behavior of the reward but
also on the horizon (time steps) required for making decisions. Our proposal for functional safety
is twofold. First we decompose the Policy function into a composition of a Policy for Desires
(which is to be learned) and trajectory planning with hard constraints (which is not learned). The goal
of Desires is to enable comfort of driving, while hard constraints guarantees the safety of driving
(detailed in sec. 4). Second, following the options mechanism of [33] we employ a hierarchical
temporal abstraction we call an “Option Graph” with a gating mechanism that signiﬁcantly reduces the
effective horizon and thereby reducing the variance of the gradient estimation even further (detailed
in sec. 5). The Option Graph plays a similar role to “structured prediction” in supervised learning
(e.g. [36]), thereby reducing sample complexity, while also playing a similar role to LSTM [14]
gating mechanisms used in supervised deep networks. The use of options for skill reuse was also
been recently studied in [37], where hierarchical deep Q networks for skill reuse have been proposed.
Finally, in sec. 6, we demonstrate the application of our algorithm on a double merging maneuver
which is notoriously difﬁcult to execute using conventional motion and path planning approaches.
Safe reinforcement learning was also studied recently in [3]. Their approach involves ﬁrst optimizing
the expected reward (using policy gradient) and then applying a (Bregman) projection of the solution
onto a set of linear constraints. This approach is different from our approach. In particular, it assumes
that the hard constraints on safety can be expressed as linear constraints on the parameter vector θ.
In our case θ are the weights of a deep network and the hard constraints involve highly non-linear
dependency on θ. Therefore, convex-based approaches are not applicable to our problem.

Reinforcement Learning without Markovian Assumption
We begin with setting up the RL notations geared towards deriving a Policy Gradient method with
variance reduction while not making any Markov assumptions. We follow the REINFORCE [42]
likelihood ratio trick and make a very modest contribution — more an observation than a novel
derivation — that Markov assumptions on the environment are not required. Let S be our state
space which contains the “environmental model” around the vehicle generated from interpreting
sensory information and any additional useful information such as the kinematics of moving objects
from previous frames. We use the term “state space” in order not to introduce new terminology but
we actually mean a state vector in an agnostic sense, without the Markov assumptions — simply
a collection of information around the vehicle generated at a particular time stamp. Let A denote
the action space, where at this point we will keep it abstract and later in sec. 5 we will introduce a
speciﬁc discrete action space for selecting “desires” tailored to the domain of autonomous driving.
The hypothesis class of parametric stochastic policies is denoted by {πθ : θ ∈Θ}, where for all θ, s
we have P
a πθ(a|s) = 1, and we assume that πθ(a|s) is differentiable w.r.t. θ. Note that we have
chosen a class of policies πθ : S × A →[0, 1] as part of an architectural design choice, i.e., that the
(distribution over) action at at time t is determined by the agnostic state st and in particular, given
the differentiability over θ, the policy πθ is implemented by a deep layered network. In other words,
we are not claiming that the optimal policy is necessarily contained in the hypothesis class but that
“good enough” policies can be modeled using a deep network whose input layer consists of st. The
theory below does not depend on the nature of the hypothesis class and any other design choices
can be substituted — for example, πθ(at|st, st−1) would correspond to the class of recurrent neural
networks (RNN).
Let ¯s = ((s1, a1), . . . , (sT , aT )) deﬁne a sequence (trajectory) of state-action over a time period
sufﬁcient for long-term planning, and let ¯si:j = ((si, ai), . . . , (sj, aj)) denote a sub-trajectory from
time stamp i to time stamp j. Let Pθ(¯s) be the probability of trajectory ¯s when actions are chosen
according to the policy πθ and there are no other assumptions on the environment. The total reward
associated with the trajectory ¯s is denoted by R(¯s) which can be any function of ¯s. For example,
R can be a function of the immediate rewards, r1, . . . , rT , such as R(¯s) = P
t rt or the discounted
reward R(¯s) = P
t γtrt for γ ∈(0, 1]. But, any reward function of ¯s can be used and therefore we
can keep it abstract. Finally, the learning problem is:
argmax
θ∈Θ
E
¯s∼Pθ[R(¯s)]
The gradient policy theorem below follows the standard likelihood ratio trick (e.g., [2, 11]) and the
formula is well known, but in the proof (which follows the proof in [25]), we make the observation
that Markov assumptions on the environment are not required for the validity of the policy gradient
estimator:
Theorem 1 Denote
ˆ∇(¯s) = R(¯s)
T
X
t=1
∇θ log(πθ(at|st))
(1)
Then, E¯s∼Pθ ˆ∇(¯s) = ∇E¯s∼Pθ[R(¯s)].
The gradient policy theorem shows that it is possible to obtain an unbiased estimate of the gradient of
the expected total reward [42, 32, 12], thereby using noisy gradient estimates in a stochastic gradient
ascent/descent (SGD) algorithm for training a deep network representing the policy πθ. Unfortunately,
the variance of the gradient estimator scales unfavorably with the time horizon T and moreover due
to the very low probability of critical “corner” cases, such as the probability of an accident p, the
immediate reward −r must satisfy r ≫1/p and in turn the variance of the random variable R(¯s)
grows with pr2, i.e., much larger than 1/p (see sec. 4 and Lemma 3). High variance of the gradient
has a detrimental effect on the convergence rate of SGD [22, 29, 16, 28, 24] and given the nature of
our problem domain, with extremely low-probability corner cases, the effect of an extremely high
variance could bring about bad policy solutions.
We approach the variance problem along three thrusts. First, we use base-line subtraction methods
(which goes back to [42]) for variance reduction. Second, we deal with the variance due to “corner”
cases by decomposing the policy into a learnable part and a non-learnable part, the latter induces

hard constraints on functional safety. Last, we introduce a temporal abstraction method with a gating
mechanism we call an “option graph” to ameliorate the effect of the time horizon T on the variance.
In Section 3 we focus on base-line subtraction, derive the optimal baseline (following [25]) and
generalize the recent results of [26] to a non-Markovian setting. In the next section we deal with
variance due to “corner cases”.

Variance Reduction
Consider again policy gradient estimate ˆ∇(¯s) introduced in eqn.1. The baseline subtraction method
reduces the variance of R(¯s) by subtracting a scalar bt,i from R(¯s):
ˆ∇i(¯s) =
T
X
t=1
(R(¯s) −bt,i)∇θi log(π(at|st)) .
The Lemma below describes the conditions on bt,i for the baseline subtraction to work:
Lemma 1 For every t and i, let bt,i be a scalar that does not depend on at, ¯st+1:T , but may depend
on ¯s1:t−1, st, and on θ. Then,
E

The optimal baseline, one that would reduce the variance the most, can be derived following [25]:
E ˆ∇i(¯s)2 = E
 T
X
t=1
(R(¯s) −bt,i)∇θi log(π(at|st))

Taking the derivative w.r.t. bτ,i and comparing to zero we obtain the following equation for the
optimal baseline:
E
 T
X
t=1
(R(¯s) −bt,i)∇θi log(π(at|st))

(∇θi log(π(aτ|sτ))) = 0 .
This can be written as Xb

y,
where X
is a T × T
matrix with Xτ,t

E ∇θi log(π(at|st))∇θi log(π(aτ|sτ))
and
y
is
a

vector
with
yt
=
E R(¯s)∇θi log(π(at|st))∇θi log(π(aτ|sτ)). We can estimate X and y from a mini-batch of episodes
and then set b·,i to be X−1y. A more efﬁcient approach is to think about the problem of ﬁnding the
baseline as an online linear regression problem and have a separate process that update b·,i in an
online manner [27].
Many policy gradient variants [26] replace R(¯s) with the Q-function, which assumes the Markovian
setting. The following lemma gives a non-Markovian analogue of the Q function.
Lemma 2 Deﬁne
Qθ(¯s1:t) :=

Let ξ be a random variable and let ˆQθ(¯s1:t, ξ) be a function such that Eξ ˆQθ(¯s1:t, ξ) = Qθ(¯s1:t) (in
particular, we can take ξ to be empty and then ˆQ ≡Q). Then,

Observe that the following analogue of the value function for the non-Markovian setting,
Vθ(¯s1:t−1, st) =
X

πθ(at|st) Qθ(¯s1:t) ,
(3)
satisﬁes the conditions of Lemma 1. Therefore, we can also replace R(¯s) with an analogue of
the so-called Advantage function, A(¯s1:t) = Qθ(¯s1:t) −Vθ(¯s1:t−1, st). The advantage function,
and generalization of it, are often used in actor-critique policy gradient implementations (see for
example [26]). In the non-Markovian setting considered in this paper, the Advantage function is more
complicated to estimate, and therefore, in our experiments, we use estimators that involve the term
R(¯s) −bt,i, where bt,i is estimated using online linear regression.

Safe Reinforcement Learning
In the previous section we have shown how to optimize the reinforcement learning objective by policy
stochastic gradient ascent. Recall that we have deﬁned the objective to be E¯s∼Pθ R(¯s), that is, the
expected reward. Objectives that involve expectation are common in machine learning. We now
argue that this objective poses a functional safety problem.
Consider a reward function for which R(¯s) = −r for trajectories that represent a rare “corner” event
which we would like to avoid, such as an accident, and R(¯s) ∈[−1, 1] for the rest of the trajectories.
For concreteness, suppose that our goal is to learn to perform an overtake maneuver. Normally, in an
accident free trajectory, R(¯s) would reward successful, smooth, takeovers and penalize against staying
in lane without completing the takeover — hence the range [−1, 1]. If a sequence, ¯s, represents
an accident, we would like the reward −r to provide a sufﬁciently high penalty to discourage such
occurrences. The question is what should be the value of r to ensure accident-free driving?
Observe that the effect of an accident on E[R(¯s)] is the additive term −pr, where p is the probability
mass of trajectories with an accident event. If this term is negligible, i.e., p ≪1/r, then the learner
might prefer a policy that performs an accident (or adopt in general a reckless driving policy) in order
to fulﬁll the takeover maneuver successfully more often than a policy that would be more defensive
at the expense of having some takeover maneuvers not completed successfully. In other words, if
we want to make sure that the probability of accidents is at most p then we must set r ≫1/p. Since
we would like p to be extremely small (say, p = 10−9), we obtain that r must be extremely large.
Recall that in policy gradient we estimate the gradient of E[R(¯s)]. The following lemma shows that
the variance of the random variable R(¯s) grows with pr2, which is larger than r for r ≫1/p. Hence,
even estimating the objective is difﬁcult, let alone its gradient.
Lemma 3 Let πθ be a policy and let p, r be scalars such that with probability p we have R(¯s) = −r
and with probability 1 −p we have R(¯s) ∈[−1, 1]. Then,
Var[R(¯s)] ≥pr2 −(pr + (1 −p))2 = (p −p2)r2 −2p(1 −p)r −(1 −p)2 ≈pr2 ,
where the last approximation holds for the case r ≥1/p.
The above discussion shows that an objective of the form E[R(¯s)] cannot ensure functional safety
without causing a serious variance problem. The baseline subtraction method for variance reduction
would not offer a sufﬁcient remedy to the problem because we would be shifting the problem from
very high variance of R(¯s) to equally high variance of the baseline constants whose estimation
would equally suffer numerical instabilities. Moreover, if the probability of an accident is p then
on average we should sample at least 1/p sequences before obtaining an accident event. This
immediately implies a lower bound of 1/p samples of sequences for any learning algorithm that aims
at minimizing E[R(¯s)]. We therefore face a fundamental problem whose solution must be found in a
new architectural design and formalism of the system rather than through numerical conditioning
tricks.
Our approach is based on the notion that hard constraints should be injected outside of the learning
framework. In other words, we decompose the policy function into a learnable part and a non-
learnable part. Formally, we structure the policy function as πθ = π(T ) ◦π(D)
θ
, where π(D)
θ
maps
the (agnostic) state space into a set of Desires, while π(T ) maps the Desires into a trajectory
(which determines how the car should move in a short range). The function π(D)
θ
is responsible
for the comfort of driving and for making strategical decisions such as which other cars should
be over-taken or given way and what is the desired position of the host car within its lane and so
forth. The mapping from state to Desires is a policy π(D)
θ
that is being learned from experience by
maximizing an expected reward. The desires produced by π(D)
θ
are translated into a cost function
over driving trajectories. The function π(T ), which is not being learned, is implemented by ﬁnding a
trajectory that minimizes the aforementioned cost subject to hard constraints on functional safety.
This decomposition allows us to always ensure functional safety while at the same time enjoying
comfort driving most of the time.
To illustrate the idea, let us consider a challenging driving scenario, which we call the double merge
scenario (see Figure 1 for an illustration). In a double merge, vehicles approach the merge area from
both left and right sides and, from each side, a vehicle can decide whether to merge into the other
6

side or not. Successfully executing a double merge in busy trafﬁc requires signiﬁcant negotiation
skills and experience and is notoriously difﬁcult to execute in a heuristic or brute force approach by
enumerating all possible trajectories that could be taken by all agents in the scene.
Figure 1: The double merge sce-
nario. Vehicles arrive from the
left or right side to the merge area.
Some vehicles should continue
on their road while other vehicles
should merge to the other side. In
dense trafﬁc, vehicles must nego-
tiate the right of way.
We begin by deﬁning the set of Desires D appropriate for the
double merge maneuver. Let D be the Cartesian product of the
following sets:
D = [0, vmax] × L × {g, t, o}n
where [0, vmax] is the desired target speed of the host vehicle,
L = {1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4} is the desired lateral position in lanes
units where whole numbers designate lane center and fraction num-
bers designate lane boundaries, and {g, t, o} are classiﬁcation labels
assigned to each of the n other vehicles. Each of the other vehicles
is assigned ‘g’ if the host vehicle is to “give way” to it, or ‘t’ to “take
way” and ‘o’ to maintain an offset distance to it.
Next
we
describe
how
to
translate
a
set
of
Desires,
(v, l, c1, . . . , cn) ∈D, into a cost function over driving trajecto-
ries. A driving trajectory is represented by (x1, y1), . . . , (xk, yk),
where (xi, yi) is the (lateral,longitudinal) location of the car (in ego-
centric units) at time τ ·i. In our experiments, we set τ = 0.1sec and
k = 10. The cost assigned to a trajectory will be a weighted sum
of individual costs assigned to the desired speed, lateral position,
and the label assigned to each of the other n vehicles. Each of the
individual costs are descried below.
Given a desired speed v ∈[0, vmax], the cost of a trajectory associated with speed is Pk
i=2(v −
∥(xi, yi) −(xi−1, yi−1)∥/τ )2. Given desired lateral position l ∈L, the cost associated with desired
lateral position is Pk
i=1 dist(xi, yi, l), where dist(x, y, l) is the distance from the point (x, y) to the
lane position l. As to the cost due to other vehicles, for any other vehicle let (x′
1, y′
1), . . . , (x′
k, y′
k) be
its predicted trajectory in the host vehicle egocentric units, and let i be the earliest point for which
there exists j such that the distance between (xi, yi) and (x′
j, y′
j) is small (if there is no such point
we let i = ∞). If the car is classiﬁed as “give-way” we would like that τ i > τ j + 0.5, meaning that
we will arrive to the trajectory intersection point at least 0.5 seconds after the other vehicle will arrive
to that point. A possible formula for translating the above constraint into a cost is [τ (j −i) + 0.5]+.
Likewise, if the car is classiﬁed as “take-way” we would like that τ j > τ i + 0.5, which is translated
to the cost [τ (i −j) + 0.5]+. Finally, if the car is classiﬁed as “offset” we would like that i will be
∞(meaning, the trajectories will not intersect). This can be translated to a cost by penalizing on the
distance between the trajectories.
By assigning a weight to each of the aforementioned costs we obtain a single objective function for
the trajectory planner, π(T ). Naturally, we can also add to the objective a cost that encourages smooth
driving. More importantly, we add hard constraints that ensure functional safety of the trajectory. For
example, we do not allow (xi, yi) to be off the roadway and we do not allow (xi, yi) to be close to
(x′
j, y′
j) for any trajectory point (x′
j, y′
j) of any other vehicle if |i −j| is small.
To summarize, we decompose the policy πθ into a mapping from the agnostic state to a set of
Desires and a mapping from the Desires to an actual trajectory. The latter mapping is not
being learned and is implemented by solving an optimization problem whose cost depends on the
Desires and whose hard constraints guarantees functional safety of the policy. It is left to explain
how we learn the mapping from the agnostic state to the Desires, which is the topic of the next
section.

Temporal Abstraction
In the previous section we injected prior knowledge in order to break down the problem in such a way
to ensure functional safety. We saw that through RL alone a system complying with functional safety
will suffer a very high and unwieldy variance on the reward R(¯s) and this can be ﬁxed by splitting
the problem formulation into a mapping from (agnostic) state space to Desires using policy
gradient iterations followed by a mapping to the actual trajectory which does not involve learning.

It is necessary, however, to inject even more prior knowledge into the problem and decompose the
decision making into semantically meaningful components — and this for two reasons. First, the
size of D might be quite large and even continuous (in the double-merge scenario described in the
previous section we had D = [0, vmax] × L × {g, t, o}n). Second, the gradient estimator involves
the term PT
t=1 ∇θπθ(at|st). As mentioned above, the variance grows with the time horizon T [25] .
In our case, the value of T is roughly1 250 which is high enough to create signiﬁcant variance.

Figure 2: An options graph for
the double merge scenario.
Our approach follows the options framework due to [34]. An options
graph represents a hierarchical set of decisions organized as a Di-
rected Acyclic Graph (DAG). There is a special node called the “root”
of the graph. The root node is the only node that has no incoming
edges. The decision process traverses the graph, starting from the
root node, until it reaches a “leaf” node, namely, a node that the has
no outgoing edges. Each internal node should implement a policy
function that picks a child among its available children. There is a
predeﬁned mapping from the set of traversals over the options graph
to the set of desires, D. In other words, a traversal on the options
graph is automatically translated into a desire in D. Given a node
v in the graph, we denote by θv the parameter vector that speciﬁes
the policy of picking a child of v. Let θ be the concatenation of all
the θv, then π(D)
θ
is deﬁned by traversing from the root of the graph
to a leaf, while at each node v using the policy deﬁned by θv to pick
a child node.
A possible option graph for the double merge scenario is depicted
in Figure 2. The root node ﬁrst decides if we are within the merging
area or if we are approaching it and need to prepare for it. In both
cases, we need to decide whether to change lane (to left or right
side) or to stay in lane. If we have decided to change lane we need
to decide if we can go on and perform the lane change maneuver
(the “go” node). If it is not possible, we can try to “push” our way
(by aiming at being on the lane mark) or to “stay” in the same lane.
This determines the desired lateral position in a natural way — for
example, if we change lane from lane 2 to lane 3, “go” sets the desire
lateral position to 3, “stay” sets the desire lateral position to 2, and
“push” sets the desire lateral position to 2.5. Next, we should decide
whether to keep the “same” speed, “accelerate” or “decelerate”. Finally, we enter a “chain like”
structure that goes over all the vehicles and sets their semantic meaning to a value in {g, t, o}. This
sets the desires for the semantic meaning of vehicles in an obvious way. Note that we share the
parameters of all the nodes in this chain (similarly to Recurrent Neural Networks).
An immediate beneﬁt of the options graph is the interpretability of the results. Another immediate
beneﬁt is that we rely on the decomposable structure of the set D and therefore the policy at each
node should choose between a small number of possibilities. Finally, the structure allows us to reduce
the variance of the policy gradient estimator. We next elaborate on the last point.
As mentioned previously, the length of an episode in the double merge scenario is roughly T = 250
steps. This number comes from the fact that on one hand we would like to have enough time to see
the consequences of our actions (e.g., if we decided to change lane as a preparation for the merge,
we will see the beneﬁt only after a successful completion of the merge), while on the other hand
due to the dynamic of driving, we must make decisions at a fast enough frequency (10Hz in our
case). The options graph enables us to decrease the effective value of T by two complementary ways.
First, given higher level decisions we can deﬁne a reward for lower level decisions while taking into
account much shorter episodes. For example, when we have already picked the “lane change” and
“go” nodes, we can learn the policy for assigning semantic meaning to vehicles by looking at episodes
of 2-3 seconds (meaning that T becomes 20 −30 instead of 250). Second, for high level decisions
(such as whether to change lane or to stay in the same lane), we do not need to make decisions every
1Suppose we work at 10Hz, the merge area is 100 meters, we start the preparation for the merge 300 meters
before it, and we drive at 16 meters per second (≈60 Km per hour). In this case, the value of T for an episode is
roughly 250.

<!-- Page 9 -->
0.1 seconds. Instead, we can either make decisions at a lower frequency (e.g., every second), or
implement an “option termination” function, and then the gradient is calculated only after every
termination of the option. In both cases, the effective value of T is again an order of magnitude
smaller than its original value. All in all, the estimator at every node depends on a value of T which
is an order of magnitude smaller than the original 250 steps, which immediately transfers to a smaller
variance [21].
To summarize, we introduced the options graph as a way to breakdown the problem into semantically
meaningful components where the Desires are deﬁned through a traversal over a DAG. At each
step along the way the learner maps the state space to a small subset of Desires thereby effectively
decreasing the time horizon to much smaller sequences and at the same time reducing the output space
for the learning problem. The aggregated effect is both in reducing variance and sample complexity
of the learning problem.

Experimental Demonstration
The purpose of this section is to give a sense of how a challenging negotiation scenario is handled by
our framework. The experiment involves propriety software modules (to produce the sensing state,
the simulation, and the trajectory planner) and data (for the learning-by-imitation part). It therefore
should be regarded as a demonstration rather than a reproducible experiment. We leave to future
work the task of conducting a reproducible experiment, with a comparison to other approaches.
We experimented with the double-merge scenario described in Section 4 (see again Figure 1). This is
a challenging negotiation task as cars from both sides have a strong incentive to merge, and failure
to merge in time leads to ending on the wrong side of the intersection. In addition, the reward R(¯s)
associated with a trajectory needs to account not only for the success or failure of the merge operation
but also for smoothness of the trajectory control and the comfort level of all other vehicles in the
scene. In other words, the goal of the RL learner is not only to succeed with the merge maneuver but
also accomplish it in a smooth manner and without disrupting the driving patterns of other vehicles.
We relied on the following sensing information. The static part of the environment is represented
as the geometry of lanes and the free space (all in ego-centric units). Each agent also observes the
location, velocity, and heading of every other car which is within 100 meters away from it. Finally,
300 meters before the merging area the agent receives the side it should be after the merge (’left’
or ’right’). For the trajectory planner, π(T ), we used an optimization algorithm based on dynamic
programming. We used the option graph described in Figure 2. Recall that we should deﬁne a policy
function for every node of our option graph. We initialized the policy at all nodes using imitation
learning. Each policy function, associated with every node of the option graph, is represented by
a neural network with three fully connected hidden layers. Note that data collected from a human
driver only contains the ﬁnal maneuver, but we do not observe a traversal on the option graph. For
some of the nodes, we can infer the labels from the data in a relatively straight forward manner. For
example, the classiﬁcation of vehicles to “give-way”, “take-way”, and “offset” can be inferred from
the future position of the host vehicle relative to the other vehicles. For the remaining nodes we used
an implicit supervision. Namely, our option graph induces a probability over future trajectories and
we train it by maximizing the (log) probability of the trajectory that was chosen by the human driver.
Fortunately, deep learning is quite good in dealing with hidden variables and the imitation process
succeeded to learn a reasonable initialization point for the policy. See [1] for some videos. For
the policy gradient updates we used a simulator (initialized using imitation learning) with self-play
enhancement. Namely, we partitioned the set of agents to two sets, A and B. Set A was used as
reference players while set B was used for the policy gradient learning process. When the learning
process converged, we used set B as the reference players and used the set A for the learning process.
The alternating process of switching the roles of the sets continued for 10 rounds. See [1] for resulting
videos.

Proofs
A.1
Proof of Theorem 1
The policy πθ induces a probability distribution over sequences as follows: given a sequence
¯s = (s1, a1), . . . , (sT , aT ), we have
Pθ(¯s) =
T
Y
t=1
P[st|¯s1:t−1] πθ(at|st) .
Note that in deriving the above expression we make no assumptions on P[st|¯s1:t−1]. This stands in
contrast to Markov Decision Processes, in which it is assumed that st is independent on the past given
(st−1, at−1). The only assumption we make is that the (random) choice of at is solely based on st,
which comes from our architectural design choice of the hypothesis space of policy functions. The
remainder of the proof employs the standard likelihood ratio trick (e.g., [2, 11]) with the observation
that since P[st|¯s1:t−1] does not depend on the parameters θ it gets eliminated in the policy gradient.
This is detailed below for the sake of completeness:
