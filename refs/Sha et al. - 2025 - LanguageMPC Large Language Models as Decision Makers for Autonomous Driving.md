Abstract— Existing learning-based autonomous driving (AD)
systems face challenges in comprehending high-level informa-
tion, generalizing to rare events, and providing interpretability.
To address these problems, this work employs Large Language
Models (LLMs) as a decision-making component for complex
AD scenarios that require human commonsense understand-
ing. We devise cognitive pathways to enable comprehensive
reasoning with LLMs, and develop algorithms for translating
LLM decisions into actionable driving commands. Through
this approach, LLM decisions are seamlessly integrated with
low-level controllers by guided parameter matrix adaptation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method
not only consistently surpasses baseline approaches in single-
vehicle tasks, but also helps handle complex driving behaviors
even multi-vehicle coordination, thanks to the commonsense
reasoning capabilities of LLMs. This paper presents an initial
step toward leveraging LLMs as effective decision-makers for
intricate AD scenarios in terms of safety, efficiency, gener-
alizability, and interoperability. We aspire for it to serve as
inspiration for future research in this field.

I. INTRODUCTION
Imagine you are behind the wheel, approaching an
unsignalized intersection and planning to turn left, with an
oncoming vehicle straight ahead. Human drivers instinctively
know to slow down and yield according to traffic rules, even
if it is possible to accelerate through the intersection. How-
ever, existing advanced learning-based Autonomous Driving

(AD) systems typically require complex rules or reward
function designs to handle such scenarios effectively [1],
[2]. This reliance on predefined rule bases often limits their
ability to generalize to various situations.
Another challenge facing existing learning-based AD sys-
tems is the long-tail problem [3]. Both limited datasets and
sampling efficiency [4] can present challenges for existing
learning-based AD systems when making decisions in rare
real-world driving scenarios. Chauffeurnet [5] demonstrated
such limits where even 30 million state-action samples were
insufficient to learn an optimal policy that mapped bird’s-eye
view images (states) to control (action).
Furthermore, the lack of interpretability [6] is a pressing
issue for existing learning-based AD systems. A mature
AD system must possess interpretability to gain recognition
within society and regulatory entities, allowing it to be
subject to targeted optimization and iterative improvements.
Nevertheless, existing learning-based AD systems inherently
resemble black boxes, making it challenging to discern their
decision-making processes or understand the rationale behind
their actions [4]. This lack of transparency can pose obstacles
to the practical implementation of AD systems.
Considering the aforementioned challenges, a fundamental
question arises: Can we equip AD systems with the capability
to think and drive like humans? Our proposed solution
involves employing a Large Language Model (LLM) to serve
as the ”brain” of the AD system.
Recent introductions of models like ChatGPT [7], have
positioned LLMs as having a certain level of human-like rea-
soning capabilities, owing to their innovative techniques such
as Instruct Following and In-Context Learning (ICL) [8].

adjustment, which dynamically adjust observation matrices Ot, action bias ˆ
At, and cost function weights Wt, guiding the
MPC to execute appropriate control behaviors.
LLMs can think like humans [9], and reason about new
scenarios by combining common sense, and the visible
thinking process makes them somewhat interpretable. These
features make LLMs a powerful solution to the problems
faced by AD systems described above.
In this paper, we leverage LLMs to analyze and reason
about various scenarios, enabling it to provide high-level
decisions, and by tuning parameter matrix, we convert high-
level decisions into mathematical representations to guide
the bottom-level controller, Model Predictive Control (MPC).
Fig. 1 illustrates the reasoning capabilities of our system for
rare and complex scenarios, demonstrating its superiority in
understanding high-level information, commonsense reason-
ing, and interpretability. Through quantitative experiments,
we showcase that our system significantly surpasses existing
learning-based and optimization-based methods for single-
vehicle decision-making tasks, with Overall Cost decreasing
by 18.1% and 16.4%. Additionally, through qualitative ex-
periments, we demonstrate the capabilities of our system in
addressing complex tasks, such as multi-vehicle joint control
and driving behavior modulation guided by textual input. The
main contributions of this paper are as follows:
1) We developed LanguageMPC, an end-to-end system
that processes observations and outputs driving actions,
guided by high-level, human-like decisions from the
LLM. This integration enhances the understanding of
complex scenarios and improves interpretability.
2) We develop a method that translates high-level textual
decisions from the LLM into precise driving actions
for the bottom-level controller, integrating the LLM’s
decision-making capabilities with the real-time control
and robustness of the bottom-level controller.
3) We demonstrate through quantitative experiments that
LanguageMPC outperforms existing methods in key met-
rics. Additionally, it effectively manages complex tasks
such as multi-vehicle coordination and driving behavior
adjustment based on textual inputs.
II. RELATED WORK
Autonomous Driving Autonomy. Modularity [10] plays
an important role in many autonomous driving systems. It
divides the complex autonomous driving task into multiple
subproblems, including perception [11], planning [12], and
control [13], making each module relevant and somewhat in-
terpretable. However, it also presents challenges in areas such
as compatibility, error accumulation and inefficiency[14].
Recently, there was a large progress in end-to-end deep
learning methods for autonomous systems [15], [16], [17].
Though autonomous driving systems have achieved remark-
able successes in planning and decision-making [12], [18],
there are still problems in terms of interpretability [6],
[14]. At the same time, limitations in data and sampling
efficiency [4] make it vulnerable to dealing with long-
tail situations, especially interaction scenarios, in real-world
environments [19].
Large Language Models for Autonomous Driving. The
remarkable achievements of LLMs are undeniably captivat-
ing, demonstrating LLM’s human-like reasoning skills and
generalization of human commonsense [20], [21]. In the
autonomous driving industry, LLMs have the potential to rev-
olutionize the paradigm of perception and decision-making.
On the perceptual side, researchers combine visual encoders
with LLM [22] to enhance the AD system’s understanding
of visual high-level concepts contained in images [23] and
videos [24]. Recent works such as DriveGPT4 [25], HiLM-
D [26], and Talk2BEV [27] have even demonstrated the pow-
erful environment perception capabilities of LLMs enabled
by vectorized visual embedding techniques. In planning and
decision-making, extensive research has shown that pre-
trained LLMs integrate human common sense and help make
human-like decisions [28], [29], [30]. Also, the involve-
ment of LLMs greatly enhances interpretability and safety,
providing the potential to comprehend the transparency of
the decision process. [25], [29], [31] showed that LLMs
can reason about the transportation environment under the
guidance of prompt and explain the decision process. In

Given three potential future trajectories for each vehicle,
the LLM first selects the most likely trajectory to predict,
representing it as Pt using Bessel Curve control points. It
then identifies the relevant traffic participants, setting those
needing no attention to 0 via a binary mask Mt.
addition, LLMs show the potential to address interoperability
challenges [32], [33]. [34], [35], [36] uses language as
a bridge between multimodal data, enabling the union of
perception and decision-making, demonstrating powerful un-
derstanding and reasoning. However, the above work mainly
focuses on demonstrating the perception, reasoning and high-
level decision-making capabilities of LLMs, which are still
lacking in generating final control actions. While [9], [34]
can generate planning trajectories, [9] relies on predefined
fixed rules, and [34] still requires the output of LLMs to
be decoded into trajectories using a deep learning model,
and the decoder still faces the problem of being limited by
the training set. In this work, we combine the LLM directly
with the controller MPC and use the powerful reasoning
and decision-making capabilities of the LLM to guide the
generation of the final control actions, allowing the system
to drive like a human.
III. METHODOLOGY
We present an AD system that integrates the LLM with
MPC to enhance decision-making in complex traffic scenar-
ios. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the LLM serves as the core
component for high-level reasoning and decision-making,
while the MPC acts as the low-level controller to execute
decisions in real time.
The decision-making process begins with a prompt gen-
erator that translates real-time scenario data into descriptive
text. This text includes details about static road elements,
dynamic information about vehicles, and system prompts like
traffic rules. The LLM processes information through three
sequential stages: 1) scenario encoding, 2) action guidance,
and 3) weight adjustment. These stages collectively enable
the system to accomplish scene understanding, reasoning,
and high-level decision-making. Once these textual decisions
are made, they are converted into mathematical representa-
tions: the observation matrix, action bias, and weight matrix.
These elements guide bottom-level controller, the MPC, to
give specific driving actions.
This framework integrates the advanced reasoning and
decision-making capabilities of the LLM with the robustness
and real-time control efficiency of the MPC:
1) The LLM functions as the ”brain” of the AD system,
enabling high-level reasoning and decision-making.

Fig. 4: Weight Adjustment. The LLM selects weights from
the weight pool to balance the four components: tracking, ac-
tion penalty, smoothness, and safety. In the example shown,
the LLM selects a larger Ws, making Cact > Ctrk, which
prompts the MPC to prioritize following the LLM’s decision
to stop and wait over tracking the reference trajectory.
2) The MPC implements the LLM’s decisions under soft
constraints, ensuring robust yet flexible control.
3) Together, the LLM and MPC form a dual-frequency
system that balances the longer inference time of the
LLM with the real-time execution capabilities of the
MPC, achieving effective real-time control.
A. MPC Controller
The MPC solves a finite-time open-loop optimization
problem online at each time step, based on the current
measurement information obtained, and applies the initial
control action from the optimal sequence to the vehicle.
The cost function of MPC is defined in the context
of Markov Decision Process (MDP), which is commonly
used to formulate vehicle control problems: (S, A, C, P, p0),
where S represents the state space, A the action space,
C : S × A 7→R the cost function, P : S × A 7→S the
state transition function, and p0 the initial state distribution.
The objective of the MPC is to find a sequence of actions
u1:H = u1, . . . , uH that minimizes the expected cumulative
cost J(u1:H) = PH
t=1 C(st, ut).
The cost function takes the following form:
C(s, u) =
M
X
i=0
wi · ni
 ri(s, u, ζi)
,
(1)
where w ∈R+ are non-negative weights, n(·) : R →R+
is a twice-differentiable norm that reaches its minimum
value at 0, and ri are residual terms parameterized by ζi.
Designing a universal set of weights and residual terms for
all driving scenarios is impractical due to the diversity of
conditions encountered in real-world driving. Additionally,
increasing the complexity of the cost function may reduce
robustness [37]. Therefore, we use a simplified set of residual
terms that incorporate action biases, adapting the weight
matrices W = {Wi} based on LLM’s high-level decisions.
The overall cost function is constructed as:
C(s, u) = Ctrk(s, u) + Cact(s, u) + Csaf(s, u)
(2)

<!-- Page 4 -->
We first generate a reference trajectory without considering
signals and other traffic participants and then aim to follow
that trajectory:
Ctrk = XT WxX + V T WvV + ΘT WθΘ,
(3)
where X = (x, y)T represents the location, V = (vx, vy)T
the velocity, Θ = (θ, ψ)T with θ being the steering angle
and ψ the yaw angle.
To ensure smooth control, we impose limits on accelera-
tion a and steering angle θ:
Cact = A
T WsA + ∇AT Wg∇A + ∇2AT Wl∇2A
(4)
where A = (a, θ)T and A = A−ˆA, with ˆA being the action
bias given by LLM.
Lastly, we include a safety cost to maintain a safe distance
from other vehicles:
Csaf = wsaf · PN
i=0(di −ˆdi)2,
(5)
where di represents the actual distance to other vehicles, and
ˆdi is the desired safety distance.
All weight matrices Wi are diagonal. The LLM adapts the
parameters st, W, and ˆA for complex driving scenarios to
guide the MPC controller.
B. Scenario Encoding
After the processing of the prompt generator, the LLM
obtains current and short-term historical information about
the scenario. This information is structured into an observa-
tion matrix, Ot = {Ost
t , Ody
t }, for the MPC to compute cost
function, where Ost
t represents static environmental elements
and Ody
t
represents dynamic information about surrounding
vehicles. In this section, we will describe how the LLM
optimizes and modifies Ot to improve planning of MPC.
Effective decision-making requires not only understanding
the current and historical states but also predicting future
states. To generate these predictions, we first create potential
reference trajectories based on Ost
t for the ego vehicle using
a Bessel curve:
Bref =
n
X
i=0
pi
i
n

γi(1 −γ)n−i
(6)
where pi represent the control points, including waypoint
locations and the vehicle’s position, and γ ∈[0, 1]. We use
the points on the center lines of the three nearest lanes as
control points and generate three Bessel curves. These three
reference trajectories provide potential paths for the vehicle
without considering other signals and traffic participants.
Given these control points, the LLM then acts as a predictor
to select the most suitable reference trajectory based on
the scenario context. This selected trajectory is used as the
tracking target, as discussed in section III-A. Next, the same
process is applied to generate predicted trajectories for all
traffic participants. The dynamic observation matrix is then
represented as a combination of historical data Ht and these
predicted trajectories Pt ∈RN×2n, as Ody
t
= (Ht, Pt) ∈
RN×C, where N is the number of traffic participants. In
complex traffic scenarios, it is crucial to focus attention
on relevant vehicles to avoid unnecessary computation and
potential logical conflicts. To achieve this, as shown on the

right side of Fig. 3, the LLM functions as an attention allo-
cator. It identifies the vehicles that need to be prioritized and
generates a binary mask Mt ∈RN×1. This mask effectively
filters out irrelevant vehicles by setting their corresponding
data to zero in the observation matrix. The final dynamic
observation matrix for the MPC is computed as:
Ody
t
= MtJT (Ht, Pt),
(7)
where J
∈RN×1 is a vector of ones. This approach
ensures that the MPC focuses only on the relevant traffic
participants, enabling efficient and effective decision-making.
The MPC will then use the LLM-selected trajectory of the
ego vehicle to calculate Ctrk for tracking and Csaf using
Ody
t , optimizing the decision.
After the scenario encoding stage, LanguageMPC will
further give action guidance. Since most LLMs have limited
sensitivity to precise numerical values [38], we discretize
the action A = (a, θ)T into a set of intervals. The midpoint
of the LLM-selected interval is then used as action bias ˆA,
which guides the MPC to generate control actions that align
with the high-level decisions of the LLM.
One challenge with MPC is its limited ability to gen-
eralize across diverse scenarios, as it relies on prede-
fined weights W
=
Wi
[37]. In our approach, as
detailed in Section III-A, the weight matrices W
=
{Wx, Wv, Wθ, Ws, Wg, Wl, wsafe} are categorized into four
components: tracking {Wx, Wv, Wθ}, action panelty Ws,

smoothness {Wg, Wl}, and safety wsaf. Unlike fixed weight
matrices designed for all scenarios, LanguageMPC dynami-
cally selects weights from a predefined pool for each specific
scenario, as shown in Fig. 4. These weights directly influence
the cost function, guiding the MPC to adjust the trade-offs
among the four components. This approach allows the MPC
to adapt to different situations while ensuring robust control
without relying on direct action commands from the LLM.
C. Dual-frequency System
The decision-making speed of the LLM in LanguageMPC
is relatively slow due to its large number of parameters. To
address this, we implement a dual-frequency system inspired
by DriveVLM [39]. In this system, we separate decision-
making into two levels: low-frequency for high-level deci-
sions and high-frequency for trajectory planning and con-
trol. At the low-frequency level, the LLM makes strategic
decisions every few seconds. These strategic decisions are
sufficient to adapt to changes in driving conditions that occur
over a longer timescale. In contrast, the MPC operates at
the high-frequency level, performing fine-grained trajectory
planning and control between LLM decisions. It generates
real-time control actions based on the high-level guidance
provided by the LLM. This dual-frequency approach bal-
ances the slower, computationally intensive inference of the
LLM with the real-time demands of vehicle control, allowing
LanguageMPC to achieve robust performance in dynamic
driving scenarios.
IV. EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we evaluate the performance of Lan-
guageMPC, using GPT-3.5 as the base LLM model and
LangChain as the manager of LLM text output. We assess its
reasoning and decision-making capabilities through a series
of experiments designed to test its effectiveness in single-
vehicle decision-making and its adaptability to complex
scenarios, such as driving behavior modulation and multi-
vehicle coordination. We conduct quantitative experiments to
measure its performance on various driving tasks and quali-
tative analyses to showcase its ability to handle challenging
situations, including rare corner cases and coordinated ac-
tions between multiple vehicles.
A. Settings
Simulator. We conduct simulation experiments using the
SUMO simulator [40] with IDSim [41] to generate dy-
namic traffic scenarios, including vehicles, bicycles, and
pedestrians. Five distinct driving scenarios are evaluated:
Signalized Intersections, Unsignalized Intersections, Lanes,
Roundabouts, and Emergency Obstacle Avoidance. Each
scenario is initialized with varying road structures, traffic
densities, and participant behaviors to simulate challenging
conditions. Traffic parameters (densities, positions, speeds,
target positions, aggressiveness) are randomly initialized and
simulated with the IDSim agent. From these generated sce-
narios, we exclude straightforward situations, such as driving
straight within a lane, and instead focus on complex corner
cases, with 25 different scenes reserved for each scenario.
For Emergency Obstacle Avoidance, low-speed vehicles are
randomly placed in front of the ego vehicle to simulate
sudden obstacles.
Baselines. We compare LanguageMPC against two base-

lines: 1) Model Predictive Control (MPC) [42]: We use a
traditional MPC system with a fixed weight matrix, consis-
tent with the control module in LanguageMPC. The dynamic
observation matrix Ody
t
incorporates all traffic participants
within the sensing range. To predict the movement of these
participants, all waypoints are used as control points for
generating reference trajectories. The trajectory closest to
each participant’s current path is chosen as the predicted
trajectory. This baseline has been finely tuned and validated
using real-world vehicle experiments conducted at iDLab,
Tsinghua University. 2) Reinforcement Learning-Based
Planning (RL): We employ four RL methods: Deep Q-
Network (DQN) [43], Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
[44], Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) [45], and Finite-Horizon Ap-
proximate Dynamic Programming (ADP)[42], [46]. For all
RL methods, the MPC observation matrix Ot is used as
input to produce the control action A = (a, θ)T . Training
is performed on IDSim across the five types of randomly
generated scenarios, with a total of 2 × 105 epochs.
B. Metrics
Failure and Collision Cases (Fail/Col.): We track failure
cases where the ego vehicle fails to reach its target area
within a 200-second time frame. Collision cases are recorded
separately to monitor safety incidents.
Inefficiency (Ineff): We measure traffic flow efficiency by
calculating the average speed difference between the ego
vehicle’s maximum speed and its current speed:
Peff = 1
N
PN
i=1(vmax
i
−vi)
(8)
This metric focuses on the lead vehicle within each convoy,
as it is most affected by the ego vehicle’s driving behavior.
Vehicles stopped at red lights are excluded.
Time Efficiency (Time): This metric records the time taken
by the ego vehicle to reach its target area, reflecting the
overall driving efficiency.
Safety Penalty (Penalty): The penalty metric assesses the
safety of the ego vehicle’s driving behavior.It considers
both the distance between the ego vehicle and surrounding
vehicles, and the deceleration of those vehicles. Smaller
distances and higher deceleration rates indicate more unsafe
driving and contribute to a higher penalty score:

driving commands, it safely overtakes the slower vehicle.
where f is a step function from 0 to 1 with a0 −ai = 0 as
the cutoff.
Overall Cost (O.C.): To provide a comprehensive evalu-
ation, we combine the above metrics into an overall cost
function using weighted values:
O.C. = Peff + 1.5t + 15Pacc + 20Pdist
(10)
These weights balance the influence of each metric, ensuring
that each contributes equally by matching their magnitudes.
C. Single-vehicle Decision-making
The quantitative results in Table I show significant reduc-
tions in overall cost across all scenarios, including Emer-
gency Obstacle Avoidance, highlighting our system’s supe-
rior driving performance. It reports minimal failures and no
collisions, demonstrating safety and reliability.
In intersection and roundabout scenarios, our method
slightly increases travel time but improves traffic flow ef-
ficiency and reduces safety penalties, reflecting cautious,
regulation-compliant driving. In lane-changing and Emer-
gency Obstacle Avoidance scenarios, it outperforms RL and
MPC across all metrics, excelling in complex and dynamic
situations.
Ablation Study. To gain deeper insights into the system’s
capabilities, we performed ablation experiments in two chal-
lenging driving scenarios: unsignalized intersections and
roundabouts, as shown in Table II. These ablations highlight
the contributions of each component of LanguageMPC.
When using only the scenario encoder, significant improve-
ments are observed in intention prediction and attention
allocation compared to baseline MPC. In contrast, using
only action bias and weight matrix adjustments leads to
substantial improvements in all metrics except time. The full
configuration, integrating both components, achieves the best
performance, showcasing the synergistic effect of scenario
understanding and high-level decision-making.
Fig. 5 illustrates how LanguageMPC components work
together. The ego vehicle navigates an unsignalized intersec-
tion, showcasing the system’s ability to predict surrounding
vehicles’ intentions, allocate attention effectively, and make
decisions aligned with traffic regulations.
1) Intention Prediction and Attention Allocation. The left

Unlike the MPC, which fails to anticipate ”vehicle 32”
yielding, LanguageMPC correctly interprets its intent and
focuses on the vehicle ahead that affects the ego vehicle’s

path. This demonstrates the LLM’s ability to understand
traffic dynamics and allocate attention for rational driving
behavior.
2) High-level Reasoning. In the same scenario, the RL
method incorrectly overtakes within the intersection, violat-
ing traffic rules. LanguageMPC, however, understands traffic
regulations and chooses to follow the vehicle until exiting
the intersection before overtaking, as shown in the dialogue
box. This demonstrates the LLM’s ability to reason about
high-level constraints and make rule-compliant decisions in
complex scenarios.
D. Text-modulated Driving
Driving Style Adjustment. Users often wish to customize
AD systems to match their preferences for efficiency and
comfort. Traditional systems require complex rule or reward
function designs [47], while our approach simplifies this by
enabling users to provide simple textual descriptions. As
shown in Fig. 6, when instructed to drive conservatively, Lan-
guageMPC slows down and follows the car ahead, whereas
an aggressive style leads to safe overtaking.
Textual Guidance for Complex Scenarios. Complex driv-
ing situations, such as road construction, pose challenges for
many AD systems [1]. Our approach addresses this by en-
abling users to provide textual instructions to guide decision-
making. As shown in Fig. 7, the LLM used textual guidance
to change lanes and avoid the blocked area, allowing the
system to adapt effectively to unusual or dynamic scenarios.
E. Multi-vehicle Joint Control
Multi-vehicle joint control enhances transportation ef-
ficiency and safety in dynamic environments. Traditional
centralized and distributed methods struggle in unpredictable
scenarios [48]. To address this, we propose a hybrid solution:
each vehicle is controlled by a distributed LLM, while a
central LLM coordinates the convoy. Each distributed LLM
shares its local status with the central LLM, which then
issues coordinated commands for adaptive decision-making.
Fig. 8 illustrates a corner case: a narrow road encounter
between two vehicles. For a single-vehicle AD system, this
scenario requires complex decision-making. However, our
approach simplifies it by leveraging both centralized and dis-
tributed LLMs. In this case, the distributed LLMs recognize
the situation, report their statuses to the central LLM, which

situation, one vehicle should

slower, so it should slow

and Agent_2 should slow 
down to its right to pass.

LLMs detect the situation and inform the central LLM, which

ceeding, demonstrating effective multi-vehicle coordination.
then coordinates actions—one vehicle decelerates while the
other proceeds. This showcases the effective collaboration
between centralized decision-making and distributed control
for optimized multi-vehicle coordination.
F. LLM Inference Delay
We evaluated the inference delay of LLMs and its impact
on decision-making performance. In our test scenario, the
number of tokens inferred by the LLM for a single decision
ranged from 2k to 4k, resulting in an average inference delay
of approximately 2.5 seconds. Notably, we implemented a
rule-based pre-evaluation process to assess emergency situ-
ations, where the LLM bypasses the scenario encoding step
and directly provides action guidance and adjusts weights.
This modification significantly reduced the inference time
during emergencies. Specifically, the number of tokens for
Emergency Obstacle Avoidance dropped to under 1.5k, and
the reasoning delay was reduced to less than 1.5 seconds. In
practice, high-level driving decisions typically evolve slowly
and coherently, meaning the inference speed of the LLM is
sufficient for most scenarios. Furthermore, LLM constraints
on MPC are soft constraints that affect the cost function,
rather than directly modifying actions. This ensures that the
MPC remains robust despite the low-frequency decisions
made by the LLM.
V. CONCLUSION
This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs as
a core component for high-level decision-making in AD
systems. By integrating LLMs with MPC, our approach
significantly improves performance in key areas such as
safety, efficiency, and adaptability, particularly in complex
and dynamic driving scenarios. The advanced reasoning
capabilities and interpretability of LLMs help address limita-
tions found in traditional learning-based methods, enhancing
both transparency and flexibility. However, a limitation of our
approach is that LLMs may not be able to respond quickly
enough to sudden and highly time-critical events that occur
on sub-second timescales. Addressing this challenge is a
key direction for future work. We hope this work inspires
continued exploration and innovation in applying LLMs to
autonomous driving, paving the way for safer, more efficient,
and adaptable transportation solutions.
