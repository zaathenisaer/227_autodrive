Abstract
We propose a new family of policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning, which al-
ternate between sampling data through interaction with the environment, and optimizing a
“surrogate” objective function using stochastic gradient ascent. Whereas standard policy gra-
dient methods perform one gradient update per data sample, we propose a novel objective
function that enables multiple epochs of minibatch updates. The new methods, which we call
proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the beneﬁts of trust region policy optimiza-
tion (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample
complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, includ-
ing simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms
other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample
complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.

Introduction
In recent years, several diﬀerent approaches have been proposed for reinforcement learning with
neural network function approximators. The leading contenders are deep Q-learning [Mni+15],
“vanilla” policy gradient methods [Mni+16], and trust region / natural policy gradient methods
[Sch+15b]. However, there is room for improvement in developing a method that is scalable (to
large models and parallel implementations), data eﬃcient, and robust (i.e., successful on a variety
of problems without hyperparameter tuning). Q-learning (with function approximation) fails on
many simple problems1 and is poorly understood, vanilla policy gradient methods have poor data
eﬃency and robustness; and trust region policy optimization (TRPO) is relatively complicated,
and is not compatible with architectures that include noise (such as dropout) or parameter sharing
(between the policy and value function, or with auxiliary tasks).
This paper seeks to improve the current state of aﬀairs by introducing an algorithm that attains
the data eﬃciency and reliable performance of TRPO, while using only ﬁrst-order optimization.
We propose a novel objective with clipped probability ratios, which forms a pessimistic estimate
(i.e., lower bound) of the performance of the policy. To optimize policies, we alternate between
sampling data from the policy and performing several epochs of optimization on the sampled data.
Our experiments compare the performance of various diﬀerent versions of the surrogate objec-
tive, and ﬁnd that the version with the clipped probability ratios performs best. We also compare
PPO to several previous algorithms from the literature. On continuous control tasks, it performs
better than the algorithms we compare against. On Atari, it performs signiﬁcantly better (in terms
of sample complexity) than A2C and similarly to ACER though it is much simpler.
1While DQN works well on game environments like the Arcade Learning Environment [Bel+15] with discrete
action spaces, it has not been demonstrated to perform well on continuous control benchmarks such as those in
OpenAI Gym [Bro+16] and described by Duan et al. [Dua+16].

Background: Policy Optimization
2.1
Policy Gradient Methods
Policy gradient methods work by computing an estimator of the policy gradient and plugging it
into a stochastic gradient ascent algorithm. The most commonly used gradient estimator has the
form
ˆg = ˆEt
h
∇θ log πθ(at | st) ˆAt
i
(1)
where πθ is a stochastic policy and ˆAt is an estimator of the advantage function at timestep t.
Here, the expectation ˆEt[. . .] indicates the empirical average over a ﬁnite batch of samples, in an
algorithm that alternates between sampling and optimization. Implementations that use automatic
diﬀerentiation software work by constructing an objective function whose gradient is the policy
gradient estimator; the estimator ˆg is obtained by diﬀerentiating the objective
LPG(θ) = ˆEt
h
log πθ(at | st) ˆAt
i
.
(2)
While it is appealing to perform multiple steps of optimization on this loss LPG using the same
trajectory, doing so is not well-justiﬁed, and empirically it often leads to destructively large policy
updates (see Section 6.1; results are not shown but were similar or worse than the “no clipping or
penalty” setting).
2.2
Trust Region Methods
In TRPO [Sch+15b], an objective function (the “surrogate” objective) is maximized subject to a
constraint on the size of the policy update. Speciﬁcally,
maximize
θ
ˆEt
 πθ(at | st)
πθold(at | st)
ˆAt

(3)
subject to
ˆEt[KL[πθold(· | st), πθ(· | st)]] ≤δ.
(4)
Here, θold is the vector of policy parameters before the update. This problem can eﬃciently be
approximately solved using the conjugate gradient algorithm, after making a linear approximation
to the objective and a quadratic approximation to the constraint.
The theory justifying TRPO actually suggests using a penalty instead of a constraint, i.e.,
solving the unconstrained optimization problem
maximize
θ
ˆEt
 πθ(at | st)
πθold(at | st)
ˆAt −β KL[πθold(· | st), πθ(· | st)]

(5)
for some coeﬃcient β. This follows from the fact that a certain surrogate objective (which computes
the max KL over states instead of the mean) forms a lower bound (i.e., a pessimistic bound) on the
performance of the policy π. TRPO uses a hard constraint rather than a penalty because it is hard
to choose a single value of β that performs well across diﬀerent problems—or even within a single
problem, where the the characteristics change over the course of learning. Hence, to achieve our goal
of a ﬁrst-order algorithm that emulates the monotonic improvement of TRPO, experiments show
that it is not suﬃcient to simply choose a ﬁxed penalty coeﬃcient β and optimize the penalized
objective Equation (5) with SGD; additional modiﬁcations are required.

Clipped Surrogate Objective
Let rt(θ) denote the probability ratio rt(θ) =
πθ(at | st)
πθold(at | st), so r(θold) = 1.
TRPO maximizes a
“surrogate” objective
LCPI(θ) = ˆEt
 πθ(at | st)
πθold(at | st)
ˆAt

= ˆEt
h
rt(θ) ˆAt
i
.
(6)
The superscript CPI refers to conservative policy iteration [KL02], where this objective was pro-
posed.
Without a constraint, maximization of LCPI would lead to an excessively large policy
update; hence, we now consider how to modify the objective, to penalize changes to the policy that
move rt(θ) away from 1.
The main objective we propose is the following:
LCLIP (θ) = ˆEt
h
min(rt(θ) ˆAt, clip(rt(θ), 1 −ϵ, 1 + ϵ) ˆAt)
i
(7)
where epsilon is a hyperparameter, say, ϵ = 0.2. The motivation for this objective is as follows. The
ﬁrst term inside the min is LCPI. The second term, clip(rt(θ), 1−ϵ, 1+ϵ) ˆAt, modiﬁes the surrogate
objective by clipping the probability ratio, which removes the incentive for moving rt outside of the
interval [1 −ϵ, 1 + ϵ]. Finally, we take the minimum of the clipped and unclipped objective, so the
ﬁnal objective is a lower bound (i.e., a pessimistic bound) on the unclipped objective. With this
scheme, we only ignore the change in probability ratio when it would make the objective improve,
and we include it when it makes the objective worse. Note that LCLIP (θ) = LCPI(θ) to ﬁrst order
around θold (i.e., where r = 1), however, they become diﬀerent as θ moves away from θold. Figure 1
plots a single term (i.e., a single t) in LCLIP ; note that the probability ratio r is clipped at 1 −ϵ
or 1 + ϵ depending on whether the advantage is positive or negative.

Figure 1: Plots showing one term (i.e., a single timestep) of the surrogate function LCLIP as a function of
the probability ratio r, for positive advantages (left) and negative advantages (right). The red circle on each
plot shows the starting point for the optimization, i.e., r = 1. Note that LCLIP sums many of these terms.
Figure 2 provides another source of intuition about the surrogate objective LCLIP . It shows how
several objectives vary as we interpolate along the policy update direction, obtained by proximal
policy optimization (the algorithm we will introduce shortly) on a continuous control problem. We
can see that LCLIP is a lower bound on LCPI, with a penalty for having too large of a policy
update.

Figure 2: Surrogate objectives, as we interpolate between the initial policy parameter θold, and the updated
policy parameter, which we compute after one iteration of PPO. The updated policy has a KL divergence of
about 0.02 from the initial policy, and this is the point at which LCLIP is maximal. This plot corresponds
to the ﬁrst policy update on the Hopper-v1 problem, using hyperparameters provided in Section 6.1.
4
Adaptive KL Penalty Coeﬃcient
Another approach, which can be used as an alternative to the clipped surrogate objective, or in
addition to it, is to use a penalty on KL divergence, and to adapt the penalty coeﬃcient so that we
achieve some target value of the KL divergence dtarg each policy update. In our experiments, we
found that the KL penalty performed worse than the clipped surrogate objective, however, we’ve
included it here because it’s an important baseline.
In the simplest instantiation of this algorithm, we perform the following steps in each policy
update:
• Using several epochs of minibatch SGD, optimize the KL-penalized objective
LKLPEN(θ) = ˆEt
 πθ(at | st)
πθold(at | st)
ˆAt −β KL[πθold(· | st), πθ(· | st)]

(8)
• Compute d = ˆEt[KL[πθold(· | st), πθ(· | st)]]
– If d < dtarg/1.5, β ←β/2
– If d > dtarg × 1.5, β ←β × 2
The updated β is used for the next policy update. With this scheme, we occasionally see policy
updates where the KL divergence is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from dtarg, however, these are rare, and
β quickly adjusts. The parameters 1.5 and 2 above are chosen heuristically, but the algorithm is
not very sensitive to them. The initial value of β is a another hyperparameter but is not important
in practice because the algorithm quickly adjusts it.
5
Algorithm
The surrogate losses from the previous sections can be computed and diﬀerentiated with a minor
change to a typical policy gradient implementation. For implementations that use automatic dif-
ferentation, one simply constructs the loss LCLIP or LKLPEN instead of LPG, and one performs
multiple steps of stochastic gradient ascent on this objective.
Most techniques for computing variance-reduced advantage-function estimators make use a
learned state-value function V (s); for example, generalized advantage estimation [Sch+15a], or the
4

<!-- Page 5 -->
ﬁnite-horizon estimators in [Mni+16]. If using a neural network architecture that shares parameters
between the policy and value function, we must use a loss function that combines the policy
surrogate and a value function error term. This objective can further be augmented by adding
an entropy bonus to ensure suﬃcient exploration, as suggested in past work [Wil92; Mni+16].
Combining these terms, we obtain the following objective, which is (approximately) maximized
each iteration:
LCLIP+V F+S
t
(θ) = ˆEt

LCLIP
t
(θ) −c1LV F
t
(θ) + c2S[πθ](st)

,
(9)
where c1, c2 are coeﬃcients, and S denotes an entropy bonus, and LV F
t
is a squared-error loss
(Vθ(st) −V targ
t
)2.
One style of policy gradient implementation, popularized in [Mni+16] and well-suited for use
with recurrent neural networks, runs the policy for T timesteps (where T is much less than the
episode length), and uses the collected samples for an update. This style requires an advantage
estimator that does not look beyond timestep T. The estimator used by [Mni+16] is
ˆAt = −V (st) + rt + γrt+1 + · · · + γT−t+1rT−1 + γT−tV (sT )
(10)
where t speciﬁes the time index in [0, T], within a given length-T trajectory segment. Generalizing
this choice, we can use a truncated version of generalized advantage estimation, which reduces to
Equation (10) when λ = 1:
ˆAt = δt + (γλ)δt+1 + · · · + · · · + (γλ)T−t+1δT−1,
(11)
where
δt = rt + γV (st+1) −V (st)
(12)
A proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm that uses ﬁxed-length trajectory segments is
shown below. Each iteration, each of N (parallel) actors collect T timesteps of data. Then we
construct the surrogate loss on these NT timesteps of data, and optimize it with minibatch SGD
(or usually for better performance, Adam [KB14]), for K epochs.

Experiments
6.1
Comparison of Surrogate Objectives
First, we compare several diﬀerent surrogate objectives under diﬀerent hyperparameters. Here, we
compare the surrogate objective LCLIP to several natural variations and ablated versions.
No clipping or penalty:
Lt(θ) = rt(θ) ˆAt
Clipping:
Lt(θ) = min(rt(θ) ˆAt, clip(rt(θ)), 1 −ϵ, 1 + ϵ) ˆAt
KL penalty (ﬁxed or adaptive)
Lt(θ) = rt(θ) ˆAt −β KL[πθold, πθ]
5

<!-- Page 6 -->
For the KL penalty, one can either use a ﬁxed penalty coeﬃcient β or an adaptive coeﬃcient as
described in Section 4 using target KL value dtarg. Note that we also tried clipping in log space,
but found the performance to be no better.
Because we are searching over hyperparameters for each algorithm variant, we chose a compu-
tationally cheap benchmark to test the algorithms on. Namely, we used 7 simulated robotics tasks2
implemented in OpenAI Gym [Bro+16], which use the MuJoCo [TET12] physics engine. We do
one million timesteps of training on each one. Besides the hyperparameters used for clipping (ϵ)
and the KL penalty (β, dtarg), which we search over, the other hyperparameters are provided in in
Table 3.
To represent the policy, we used a fully-connected MLP with two hidden layers of 64 units,
and tanh nonlinearities, outputting the mean of a Gaussian distribution, with variable standard
deviations, following [Sch+15b; Dua+16]. We don’t share parameters between the policy and value
function (so coeﬃcient c1 is irrelevant), and we don’t use an entropy bonus.
Each algorithm was run on all 7 environments, with 3 random seeds on each. We scored each
run of the algorithm by computing the average total reward of the last 100 episodes. We shifted
and scaled the scores for each environment so that the random policy gave a score of 0 and the best
result was set to 1, and averaged over 21 runs to produce a single scalar for each algorithm setting.
The results are shown in Table 1. Note that the score is negative for the setting without clipping
or penalties, because for one environment (half cheetah) it leads to a very negative score, which is
worse than the initial random policy.

Comparison to Other Algorithms in the Continuous Domain
Next, we compare PPO (with the “clipped” surrogate objective from Section 3) to several other
methods from the literature, which are considered to be eﬀective for continuous problems. We com-
pared against tuned implementations of the following algorithms: trust region policy optimization
[Sch+15b], cross-entropy method (CEM) [SL06], vanilla policy gradient with adaptive stepsize3,
2HalfCheetah, Hopper, InvertedDoublePendulum, InvertedPendulum, Reacher, Swimmer, and Walker2d, all “-v1”
3After each batch of data, the Adam stepsize is adjusted based on the KL divergence of the original and updated
policy, using a rule similar to the one shown in Section 4. An implementation is available at https://github.com/

A2C [Mni+16], A2C with trust region [Wan+16]. A2C stands for advantage actor critic, and is
a synchronous version of A3C, which we found to have the same or better performance than the
asynchronous version. For PPO, we used the hyperparameters from the previous section, with
ϵ = 0.2. We see that PPO outperforms the previous methods on almost all the continuous control
environments.

Showcase in the Continuous Domain: Humanoid Running and Steering
To showcase the performance of PPO on high-dimensional continuous control problems, we train
on a set of problems involving a 3D humanoid, where the robot must run, steer, and get up
oﬀthe ground, possibly while being pelted by cubes.
The three tasks we test on are (1) Ro-
boschoolHumanoid: forward locomotion only, (2) RoboschoolHumanoidFlagrun: position of target
is randomly varied every 200 timesteps or whenever the goal is reached, (3) RoboschoolHumanoid-
FlagrunHarder, where the robot is pelted by cubes and needs to get up oﬀthe ground. See Figure 5
for still frames of a learned policy, and Figure 4 for learning curves on the three tasks. Hyperpa-
rameters are provided in Table 4. In concurrent work, Heess et al. [Hee+17] used the adaptive KL
variant of PPO (Section 4) to learn locomotion policies for 3D robots.

Comparison to Other Algorithms on the Atari Domain
We also ran PPO on the Arcade Learning Environment [Bel+15] benchmark and compared against
well-tuned implementations of A2C [Mni+16] and ACER [Wan+16]. For all three algorithms, we
used the same policy network architechture as used in [Mni+16]. The hyperparameters for PPO
are provided in Table 5. For the other two algorithms, we used hyperparameters that were tuned
to maximize performance on this benchmark.
A table of results and learning curves for all 49 games is provided in Appendix B. We consider
the following two scoring metrics: (1) average reward per episode over entire training period (which
favors fast learning), and (2) average reward per episode over last 100 episodes of training (which
favors ﬁnal performance). Table 2 shows the number of games “won” by each algorithm, where we
compute the victor by averaging the scoring metric across three trials.

Conclusion
We have introduced proximal policy optimization, a family of policy optimization methods that use
multiple epochs of stochastic gradient ascent to perform each policy update. These methods have
the stability and reliability of trust-region methods but are much simpler to implement, requiring
only few lines of code change to a vanilla policy gradient implementation, applicable in more general
settings (for example, when using a joint architecture for the policy and value function), and have
better overall performance.
