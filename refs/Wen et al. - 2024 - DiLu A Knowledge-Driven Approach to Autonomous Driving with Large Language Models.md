ABSTRACT
Recent advancements in autonomous driving have relied on data-driven ap-
proaches, which are widely adopted but face challenges including dataset bias,
overfitting, and uninterpretability. Drawing inspiration from the knowledge-driven
nature of human driving, we explore the question of how to instill similar capa-
bilities into autonomous driving systems and summarize a paradigm that inte-
grates an interactive environment, a driver agent, as well as a memory component
to address this question. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) with emer-
gent abilities, we propose the DiLu framework, which combines a Reasoning and
a Reflection module to enable the system to perform decision-making based on
common-sense knowledge and evolve continuously. Extensive experiments prove
DiLu’s capability to accumulate experience and demonstrate a significant advan-
tage in generalization ability over reinforcement learning-based methods. More-
over, DiLu is able to directly acquire experiences from real-world datasets which
highlights its potential to be deployed on practical autonomous driving systems.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to leverage knowledge-driven capa-
bility in decision-making for autonomous vehicles. Through the proposed DiLu
framework, LLM is strengthened to apply knowledge and to reason causally in the
autonomous driving domain.

INTRODUCTION
Autonomous driving has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, propelled by the data-
driven manner (Bogdoll et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2023a;b). These data-driven algorithms strive to
capture and model the underlying distributions of the accumulated data (Bolte et al., 2019; Zhou &
Beyerer, 2023), but they always encounter challenges such as dataset bias, overfitting, and uninter-
pretability (Codevilla et al., 2019; Jin et al., 2023). Exploring methods to mitigate these challenges
could lead to a deeper understanding of driving scenarios and more rational decision-making, po-
tentially enhancing the performance of autonomous driving systems.
Drawing inspiration from the profound question posed by LeCun (2022): “Why can an adoles-
cent learn to drive a car in about 20 hours of practice and know how to act in many situations
he/she has never encountered before?”, we explore the core principles that underlie human driving
skills and raise a pivotal distinction: human driving is fundamentally knowledge-driven, as opposed
to data-driven. For example, when faced with a situation where the truck ahead is in danger of
losing its cargo, humans can rely on common sense and explainable reasoning to ensure a safe dis-
tance is maintained between vehicles. Conversely, data-driven methods rely on a large quantity of

similar data to fit this scenario which lacks environment comprehension and limits generalization
ability (Heidecker et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2022; Wen et al., 2023). Furthermore, this task requires
significant human labor and financial resources to collect and annotate driving data to handle varied
real-world scenarios. This observation catalyzes a fundamental question: How can we instill such
knowledge-driven capabilities of human drivers into an autonomous driving system?
Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) with emergent abilities offer an ideal em-
bodiment of human knowledge, providing valuable insights toward addressing this question. LLMs
possess exceptional human-level abilities and show strong abilities in robotics manipulation (Driess
et al., 2023a; Huang et al., 2023a;b), multi-modal understanding (Gao et al., 2023) and lifelong skill
learning (Wang et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023b). However, just as humans may need 20 hours of prac-
tice to learn to drive, LLMs cannot successfully perform the driving task without any experience or
guidance. Through these analyses, we summarize the knowledge-driven paradigm for autonomous
driving systems, as illustrated in Figure 1, including three components: (1) an environment with
which an agent can interact; (2) a driver agent with recall, reasoning, and reflection abilities; (3) a
memory component to persist experiences. In continuous evolution, the driver agent observes the
environment, queries, and updates experiences from memory and performs decision-making.
Following the paradigm above, we design a novel framework named DiLu as illustrated in Figure 2.
Specifically, the driver agent utilizes the Reasoning Module to query experiences from the Memory
Module and leverage the common-sense knowledge of the LLM to generate decisions based on
current scenarios. It then employs the Reflection Module to identify safe and unsafe decisions
produced by the Reasoning Module, subsequently refining them into correct decisions using the
knowledge embedded in the LLM. These safe or revised decisions are then updated into the Memory
Module.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework DiLu can leverage LLM to make
proper decisions for the autonomous driving system. We design a closed-loop driving environment
and prove that DiLu can perform better and better with the experience accumulated in the memory
module. Remarkably, with only 40 memory items, DiLu achieves comparable performance to the
reinforcement learning (RL) based methods that have extensively trained over 600,000 episodes, but
with a much stronger generalization ability to diverse scenarios. Moreover, DiLu’s ability to directly
acquire experiences from real-world datasets highlights its potential to be deployed on practical
autonomous driving systems.
The contributions of our work are summarized as follows:
• To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to leverage knowledge-driven capability
in decision-making for autonomous vehicles from the perspective of how humans drive.
We summarize the knowledge-driven paradigm that involves an interactive environment, a
driver agent, as well as a memory component.
• We propose a novel framework called DiLu which implements the above paradigm to ad-
dress the closed-loop driving tasks. The framework incorporates a Memory Module to
record the experiences, and leverages LLM to facilitate reasoning and reflection processes.

perience by interacting with the environment. Moreover, DiLu exhibits stronger gener-
alization ability than RL-based methods and demonstrates the potential to be applied in
practical autonomous driving systems.

RELATED WORKS
2.1
ADVANCEMENTS IN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS
Large language models (LLMs) are the category of Transformer-based language models that are
characterized by having an enormous number of parameters, typically numbering in the hundreds
of billions or even more. These models are trained on massive text datasets, enabling them to
understand natural language and perform a wide range of complex tasks, primarily through text
generation and comprehension (Zhao et al., 2023). Some well-known examples of LLMs include
GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023),
GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023). The emergent abilities of LLMs are one of the most significant
characteristics that distinguish them from smaller language models. Specifically, in-context learn-
ing (ICL) (Brown et al., 2020), instruction following (Ouyang et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2021) and
reasoning with chain-of-thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) are three typical emergent abilities for
LLMs. OpenAI’s pursuit of LLMs has led to the achievement of two remarkable milestones: Chat-
GPT (OpenAI, 2023) and GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023). These two milestones signify significant
advancements in LLMs’ capabilities, particularly in natural language understanding and generation.
Notably, recent developments in large LLMs have showcased human-like intelligence and hold the
potential to propel us closer to the realm of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) (Zhao et al., 2023;
Zhu et al., 2023a).
2.2
ADVANCED TASKS BASED ON LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL
Owing to the superior capability of common-sense knowledge embedded in LLMs, they are widely
adopted for diverse tasks (Sammani et al., 2022; Bubeck et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023). Fur-
thermore, there has emerged a flourishing research area that leverages LLMs to create autonomous
agents endowed with human-like capabilities (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2022; Park et al.,
2023; Fu et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2023). In particular, LLMs are shown to pos-
sess a wealth of actionable knowledge that can be extracted for robot manipulation in the form of
reasoning and planning. For instance, (Driess et al., 2023b) proposed embodied language models
that directly integrate real-world continuous sensor data into language models, establishing a direct
link between words and perceptual information. Voyager (Wang et al., 2023) introduces lifelong
learning through the incorporation of prompting mechanisms, a skill library, and self-verification.
These three modules are all grounded by LLM and empower the agent to learn more sophisticated
behaviors. Similarly, Voxposer(Huang et al., 2023b) leveraged LLMs to generate robot trajectories
for a wide range of manipulation tasks, guided by open-ended instructions and objects. Simulta-
neously, motivated by insights from AGI and the principles of embodied AI (Pfeifer & Iida, 2004;
Duan et al., 2022), the field of autonomous driving is also undergoing a profound transformation.
An open-loop driving commentator LINGO-1 is proposed by Wayve (2023) which combines vision,
language and action to enhance how to interpret and train the driving models. LLMs have demon-
strated remarkable human-level capabilities across various domains, but we observe that they lack
the inherent ability to engage with and comprehend the complex driving environment as humans. In
contrast, autonomous vehicles depend on systems that can actively interact with and understand the
driving environment. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel knowledge-driven autonomous driving
paradigm and DiLu framework that enables LLMs to comprehend driving environments and drive
by incorporating human knowledge.

OVERVIEW
Based on the knowledge-driven paradigm for autonomous driving systems introduced previously,
we propose a practical framework called DiLu, as illustrated in Figure 2. DiLu consists of four

Figure 2: The framework of DiLu. It consists of four modules: Environment, Reasoning, Reflection,
and Memory. In DiLu, the Reasoning module can observe the environment, generate prompts by
combining scenario descriptions and experiences in the Memory module, and decode responses from
the LLM to finish decision-making. Concurrently, the Reflection module evaluates these decisions,
identifies the unsafe decision to the experiences, and finally updates the revised experiences into the
Memory module.
core modules: Environment, Reasoning, Reflection, and Memory. In particular, the Reasoning
module begins by observing the environment and obtaining descriptions of the current scenario.
Concurrently, a prompt generator is employed to combine this scenario description with the few-
shot experiences of similar situations, which retrieved from the Memory module. These prompts are
then fed into an out-of-the-box Large Language Model (LLM), and the decision decoder make an
action by decoding LLM’s response.
This process is iterated within the Reasoning module, resulting in time-series decision sequences.
Subsequently, we employ the Reflection module to assess past decision sequences, categorizing
them as either safe or unsafe. The unsafe decisions are revised and these refined decisions are finally
updated back into the Memory module. Detailed implementations of the Memory, Reasoning, and
Reflection modules will be elaborated in the following sections.
3.2
MEMORY MODULE
Without few-shot experiences, the out-of-the-box LLMs fail to perform precise reasoning when
tackling the complex closed-loop driving tasks. Therefore, we employ a Memory module to store the
experiences from past driving scenarios, which include the decision prompts, reasoning processes,
and other valuable information. The memory stored in the memory module consists of two parts:
scene descriptions and corresponding reasoning processes. The scene description provides a detailed
account of the situation, serving as the key to the memory module for retrieving similar memories.
The reasoning process, on the other hand, records the appropriate method for handling the situation.
This is the value of the memory, guiding the agent towards the correct driving logic. The memory
module is constructed in three stages: initialization, memory recall, and memory storage.
Initialization: The Initialization of memory module is akin to a human attending driving school
before hitting the road. We select a few scenarios and manually outline the correct reasoning and
decision-making processes for these situations to form the initial memory. These memories instruct
the agent on the correct decision-making process for driving.
Memory recall: At each decision frame, the agent receives a textual description of the driving
scenario. Before making a decision, the current driving scenario is embedded into a vector, which
serves as the memory key. This key is then clustered and searched to find the closest scenarios (John-
son et al., 2019) in the memory module and their corresponding reasoning processes, or memories.
These recalled memories are provided to the agent in a few-shot format to assist in making accurate
reasoning and decisions for the current scenario.

Memory storage: As the agent makes correct reasoning and decisions, or reflects on the correct
reasoning process, it gains driving experience. We embed the scene description into a key, pair it
with the reasoning process to form and store memory in the memory module.
3.3
REASONING MODULE
In the Reasoning module, we utilize the experiences derived from the Memory module and the
common-sense knowledge of the LLM to perform decision-making for the current traffic scenario.
Specifically, the reasoning procedure is illustrated in Figure 3, including the following procedures:
(1) encode the scenario by a descriptor; (2) recall several experience from the Memory module;
(3) generate the prompt; (4) feed the prompt into the LLM; (5) decode the action from the LLM’s
response. The detailed prompt design can be found in Appendix A.2.
Encode the scenario by a descriptor: To facilitate DiLu’s understanding of the current traffic
conditions, the scenario descriptor transcribes the present scenario data into descriptive text. The
scenario descriptor follows a standard sentence structure and utilizes natural language to offer a
comprehensive depiction of the ongoing driving scenario. This description contains static road de-
tails as well as dynamic information regarding the ego vehicle and surrounding vehicles within the
scenario. These generated descriptions are then used as input for the prompt generator and as keys
to acquire relevant few-shot experiences from the Memory module.
Recall several experience from the Memory module: During the reasoning process, the descrip-
tion of the current driving scenario is also embedded into a vector, as illustrated in Figure 3. This
vector is then used to initiate a similarity query within the Memory module, searching for the top
k similar situations. The resulting paired scene descriptions and reasoning procedures assemble as
few-shot experiences, which are then integrated into the prompt generator.
Generate the prompt: As depicted in the blue dashed box in Figure 3, the prompts for each frame
consist of three key components: system prompts, textual descriptions from scenario descriptor, and
the few-shot experience. Within the system prompts, we offer a concise overview of the closed-loop
driving task, which includes an introduction to the content and format of task inputs and outputs,
along with constraints governing the reasoning process. In each decision frame, we construct tai-
lored prompts based on the current driving scenario. These prompts are subsequently employed by
LLM to engage in reasoning and determine the appropriate action for the current frame.
Feed the prompt into the LLM: Since the closed-loop driving task requires a complex reasoning
process to make proper decisions, we employ the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques
introduced by Wei et al. (2022). These techniques require LLM to generate a sequence of sen-
tences that describe the step-by-step reasoning logic, ultimately leading to the final decision. This
approach is adopted due to the inherent complexity and variability of driving scenarios, which may
lead to hallucinations if the language model directly produces decision results. Also, the gener-
ated reasoning process facilitates further refinement and modification of incorrect decisions by the
Reflection module in Section 3.4.

Scenario Description
You are driving on a road with 4 lanes, and you are currently
driving in the rightmost lane. Your current speed is 25.0 m/s,
acceleration is 0.0 m/s^2, and lane position is 361.18 m.
There are other vehicles driving around you:
- Vehicle `496` is driving on the lane to your left and is ahead of
you. The speed of it is 21.2 m/s, acceleration is 0.2 m/s^2, and
lane position is 372.81 m.
- Vehicle `640` is driving on the same lane as you and is ahead of
you. The speed of it is 25.0 m/s, acceleration is -0.1 m/s^2, and
lane position is 393.69 m.
Describe
Reasoning Output
I should first check if I can accelerate, then idle, finally
decelerate. I can also try to change lanes but with caution.
- At First, I need to observe the car in front of me on the
current lane, which is car `640`. The distance between me
and car `640` is 393.69 - 361.18 = 32.51 m, and the
difference in speed is 25.00 - 25.00 = 0.00 m/s. 
Car `640` is traveling 32.51 m ahead of me and its speed is
the same as mine. This distance is safe but my speed is
already at the desired level, so I should not accelerate.
- Since I cannot accelerate, I want to know if I can
maintain my current speed. I should observe car `640`.  
It is traveling 32.51 m ahead of me and its speed is the
same as mine. This distance is safe, so I can maintain my
current speed.

Decode the action from the LLM’s response: After feeding the prompt into the LLM, we decode
the final decision in action decoder. The action decoder translates LLM’s decision outcomes into
actions for the ego vehicle and provides feedback to the environment. By repeating the procedures
above, we establish a closed-loop decision-making system.
3.4
REFLECTION MODULE
In the Reasoning module, we use the LLM to undertake closed-loop driving tasks with the support
of the proposed Memory module. As a next step we hope to accumulate valuable experiences and
enrich the Memory module upon the conclusion of a driving session. To achieve this goal, we pro-
pose the Reflection module in DiLu, which continuously learns from past driving experiences. DiLu
can progressively improve its performance through the Reflection module, similar to the progression
of a novice becoming an experienced driver.
The Reflection module is illustrated in Figure 5. During the closed-loop driving task, we record the
prompts used as input based on the driving scenario and the corresponding decisions generated by
the LLM for each decision frame. Once a driving session concludes, we obtain a decision sequence,
e.g., 5 decision frames from 0 to 4 in Figure 5. When the session ends without any collisions or
hazardous incidents, indicating a successful session, DiLu proceeds to sample several key decision
frames from the sequence. These frames then directly become part of the historical driving experi-
ence and enrich the Memory module.
On the contrary, if the current session is terminated due to hazardous situations such as collisions
with other vehicles, this indicates that the driver agent has made inaccurate decisions. It is crucial for
the system to rectify the unsafe decision made by the Reasoning module. Thanks to the interpretable
chain-of-thoughts responses, we can easily find the causes of dangerous situations. Certainly, we can
ask a human expert to complete such an error correction process. However, our goal is to make the
autonomous driving system learn from mistakes on its own. We discover that LLM can effectively
act as a mistake rectifier. Our approach is to use the driving scenarios in which incorrect decisions
occurred, together with the original reasoning output, as prompts for LLM. We instruct LLM to
pinpoint the reasons behind the incorrect decision and provide the correct one. We also ask LLM to
propose strategies in order to avoid similar errors in the future. Finally, the correct reasoning process
and the revised decision learned from the mistakes are retained in Memory module.

EXPERIMENTS
In our experimental setup, we utilize the well-established Highway-env as our simulation environ-
ment, which is a widely used platform in the fields of autonomous driving and tactical decision-
making (Leurent, 2018). This environment provides several driving models and offers a realistic
multi-vehicle interaction environment. In addition, the density of vehicles and the number of lanes

are described in Appendix A.1. The demonstration video of DiLu can be found in the project page:

4.1
THE VALIDATION OF THE DILU FRAMEWORK
In this section, we primarily focus on validating the effectiveness of the DiLu framework, in partic-
ular the reasoning and reflection process with or without the Memory module. The DiLu framework
without the Memory module is referred to as the 0-shot baseline, and we conduct comparative exper-
iments with 1-shot, 3-shots, and 5-shots experiences to demonstrate the necessity of experience ac-
cumulation. The initial Memory module contains 5 human-crafted experiences. These experiences
are then used in different few-shot settings for reasoning and reflection, allowing for continuous
accumulation and updating of experiences. We conduct comparative experiments when the Memory
module has 5, 20, and 40 experiences, respectively. Each setting is repeated 10 times with different
seeds. The results are shown as a box plot in Figure 6 (a). Success Steps (SS) is the number of
consecutive frames without collision, an SS of 30 means that the ego car has completed the driving
task. We found that as the number of experiences in the Memory module increases, the performance
of the DiLu framework improves in all few-shot settings. Notably, the 5-shots setting successfully
completes the closed-loop driving task in the majority of cases in scenarios with 20 experiences.
Furthermore, when the Memory module is equipped with 40 experiences, all trials achieve a median
SS of over 25. In comparison, when the framework lacks the Memory module and runs a 0-shot
experiment, no tasks are successfully conducted and the median SS is below 5. This indicates that
LLM cannot directly perform the closed-loop driving tasks without any adaptation.
In addition, we observed that for a fixed number of memory items, the performance of the framework
improved as the number of few-shot experiences increased. Specifically, with 40 memory items, the
5-shot framework successfully passed almost all tests, while the median SS for the 3-shots and
1-shot frameworks were 27 and 25, respectively. This can be attributed to the fact that a higher
number of few-shots includes a diverse range of experiences in similar driving scenarios. When fed
into the LLM as prompts, these allow the LLM to draw on a wider range of information and decision
strategies, thereby facilitating more rational decisions. Several detailed case studies can be found in
Appendix A.3.
4.2
COMPARISON WITH REINFORCEMENT LEARNING METHOD
We conducted comparative experiments between DiLu and the SOTA reinforcement learning (RL)
method in Highway-env, GRAD (Graph Representation for Autonomous Driving) (Xi & Suk-
thankar, 2022).
GRAD is an RL-based approach specifically designed for autonomous driv-
ing scenarios, it generates a global scene representation that includes estimated future trajecto-

ries of other vehicles.
We trained GRAD under the setting of lane-4-density-2, which
means the 4-lane motorway scenarios with vehicle density of 2.0. The training details are given
in Appendix A.4 and A.5. As a comparison, DiLu used 40 experiences purely obtained from
lane-4-density-2 setting. We defined the success rate (SR) as driving without any colli-
sion for 30 decision frames and then conducted experiments under three environment settings:
lane-4-density-2, lane-5-density-2.5, and lane-5-density-3. Each setup in-
cludes 10 test scenarios with different seeds.
The results are illustrated in Figure 7 (a). Firstly, in the lane-4-density-2 setting, DiLu uses
only 40 experience in the Memory module to achieve 70% SR while the GRAD converges to 69%
SR after 600,000 training episodes. We found that many failures from GRAD are due to the in-
ability to brake in time, resulting in collisions with the vehicle ahead. This is because reinforce-
ment learning methods tend to fit the environment and fail to take human-like driving knowledge
into consideration. Secondly, we migrate DiLu and GRAD optimized on lane-4-density-2
to lane-5-density-2.5 and lane-5-density-3 settings. We observe that both methods
suffer varying degrees of performance degradation in the migrated environments, as the number of
lanes changes and traffic density increases. However, in the most complex lane-5-density-3
environment, DiLu still maintains a 35% SR without extra optimization, while the GRAD has an
85% performance drop. DiLu accumulated experience in one environment can be generalized into
another one, while RL method tends to overfit the training environment.
4.3
EXPERIMENTS ON GENERALIZATION AND TRANSFORMATION
Data-driven approaches often overfit the training environment, while human knowledge should be
domain-agnostic and can be generalized to different environments. We perform several experiments
to evaluate DiLu’s generalization and transformation abilities.
Generalization ability in different environments. We verify whether the experiences obtained
in DiLu’s Memory module have generalization capabilities. More formally, we used 20 experi-
ences obtained from the lane-4-density-2 environment, and conducted experiments in the
lane-5-density-3 setting, testing the closed-loop performance of 3-shot and 5-shot respec-
tively. The experimental results are shown in Figure 6 (b). As we can see, the 3-shot version of
DiLu achieves 13 median SS on the setting of lane-4-density-2 while decreasing to 5 media
SS under the lane-5-density-3 setting. But in the 5-shot version, we achieve 30→23 median
SS degradation in the same situation. This suggests that the ability to generalize is better with more
few-shot experience fed into the LLM.
Transformation ability using real-world dataset. Since DiLu’s Memory module stores experi-
ences in the form of natural language text, it contains environment-agnostic knowledge that can be
readily transferred to different environments. To illustrate this capability, we created two Mem-
ory modules, each containing 20 experiences extracted from two distinct sources: (1) Highway-env
and (2) CitySim, a dataset comprising real-world vehicle trajectory data (Zheng et al., 2023). We
subsequently evaluated these modules on the lane-4-density-2 and lane-5-density-3

In this section, we explore the signifi-
cance of incorporating successful experi-
ences and revised unsafe experiences in
the Reflection module through an abla-
tion study. We adopt the Memory module
containing 20 initial experiences and ob-
serve the performance change during the
new memory accumulation.
The results
are shown in Table 1. The baseline in-
dicates the system using the Memory mod-
ule with 20 initial experiences. Then we
add 12 success memories and 6 correction memories into the baseline successively. In the exper-
iments, the median success step of the baseline is only 10. However, after updating with new
experiences, all two methods achieve a median success step of over 20, and the method with both
types of experiences shows higher success steps on all statistical measures. Therefore, it is both
reasonable and effective to add two different types of experiences during reflection.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we explore the realm of instilling human-level knowledge into autonomous driving
systems. We summarize a knowledge-driven paradigm and propose the DiLu framework, which
includes a memory module for recording past driving experiences and an agent equipped with Rea-
soning and Reflection modules. Extensive experimental results showcase DiLu’s capability to con-
tinuously accumulate experience and exhibit its strong generalization ability compared to the SOTA
RL-based method. Moreover, DiLu’s ability to directly acquire experiences from real-world datasets
highlights its potential to be deployed on practical autonomous driving systems. The DiLu frame-
work, while effective, is not without limitations. Presently, it experiences a decision-making latency
of 5-10 seconds, encompassing LLM inference and API response times. Additionally, it does not
completely eradicate hallucinations generated by LLMs. Future improvements could capitalize on
recent advances in LLM compression and optimization, aiming to enhance both efficiency and ef-
fectiveness.

APPENDIX
A.1
DETAILED SETUP OF THE EXPERIMENT
Within our DiLu framework, the large language model we adopt is the GPT family developed by
OpenAI. GPT-3.5 (OpenAI, 2023) is used in the Reasoning module of the framework, which is
responsible for making reasonable decisions for the ego vehicle. GPT-4 is used in the Reflection
module since it has demonstrated significantly improved self-repair and fact-checking capabilities
compared to GPT-3.5 (Bubeck et al., 2023; Olausson et al., 2023). To serve as the Memory module
in the DiLu framework, we adopt Chroma1, an open-source embedding vector database. The sce-
nario descriptions are transformed into vectors using the text-embedding-ada-002 model of
OpenAI.
In terms of the setup for highway-env, we directly obtain vehicle information from the underlying
simulation and input it into the scenario descriptor. This information only includes each vehicle’s
position, speed, and acceleration data in the current frame, without any decision intent or potential
risk information, as shown in Figure 8. Meta-actions are used as the decision output in our ex-
periments, which include five discrete actions to control the ego vehicle: acceleration, maintaining
speed, deceleration, and lane changes to the left and right. For each closed-loop driving task, we
define a successful completion time of 30 seconds, with a decision-making frequency of 1Hz. This
means that if the ego vehicle can navigate through traffic at a reasonable speed and without colli-
sions for 30 seconds, we consider the task to be successfully completed. Unless otherwise stated,
our experimental environment is a four-lane motorway with a vehicle density of 2.0, representing
scenarios with relatively high traffic density and complexity. All other settings follow the simulator’s
default configurations.
A.2
PROMPTS EXAMPLE
In this section, we detail the specific prompts design in the reasoning and reflection modules.
Reasoning prompts As mentioned in the article, the prompts for the reasoning module primarily
consist of three parts: system prompts, scenario description, and few-shot experience. Specifically,
as shown in Figure 8, the system prompts section is entirely fixed and mainly includes an introduc-
tion to the closed-loop driving task, instructions for input and output, and formatting requirements
for LLM responses. Most of the scenario description is fixed, but three parts are directly related
to the scenario and are dynamically generated based on the current decision frame. The driving
scenario description contains information about the positions, speeds, and accelerations of the ego
vehicle and surrounding key vehicles. It’s important to note that we only embed the text of the driv-
ing scenario description into vectors and use it as a query input to the memory module. Available
action includes all meta-actions. The driving intention can be input by humans to modify the vehi-
cle’s behavior, with the default intention being: “Your driving intention is to drive safely and avoid
collisions.”
As for the few-shot experience, it is entirely obtained from the memory module. Each experience
consists of a human-LLM dialogue pair, where the human question includes the scenario description
at that decision frame, and the LLM response represents the correct (or correct after revised) rea-
soning and decision made by the driver agent. The extracted experiences are directly utilized with a
few-shot prompting technique to input into the large language model, enabling in-context learning.
Figure 9 demonstrates the results of a 3-shot experience query, which includes two ”keep speed”
decisions and one ”decelerate” decision. It’s important to note that consistency in decisions is not a
requirement within the few-shot experience.

System Prompts
You are ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI. Now you act as a mature driving assistant,
who can give accurate and correct advice for human driver in complex urban driving scenarios.
You will be given a detailed description of the driving scenario of current frame along with your
history of previous decisions. You will also be given the available actions you are allowed to take.
All of these elements are delimited by ####.
Your response should use the following format:
<reasoning>
<reasoning>
<repeat until you have a decision>
Response to user:#### <only output one `Action_id` as a int number of you decision, without any
action name or explanation. The output decision must be unique and not ambiguous, for example if you
decide to decelearate, then output `4`>
Make sure to include #### to separate every step.
You are driving on a road with 4 lanes, and you are currently
driving in the leftmost lane. Your current position is `(408.13,
0.00)`, speed is 24.03 $m/s$, acceleration is -0.05 $m/s^2$, and
lane position is 408.13 $m$.
There are other vehicles driving around you, and below is their
basic information:
- Vehicle `992` is driving on the lane to your right and is ahead
of you. The position of it is `(422.72, 4.00)`, speed is 17.25
$m/s$, acceleration is -1.33 $m/s^2$, and lane position is 422.72
$m$.
- Vehicle `712` is driving on the same lane as you and is ahead of
you. The position of it is `(442.23, 0.00)`, speed is 22.84 $m/s$,
acceleration is -1.49 $m/s^2$, and lane position is 442.23 $m$.
Your available actions are: 
IDLE - remain in the current lane with current speed Action_id: 1
Turn-right - change lane to the right of current lane Action_id: 2
Acceleration - accelerate the vehicle Action_id: 3
Deceleration - decelerate the vehicle Action_id: 4
Scenario Description

LLM response:
I have 4 actions to choose from. Now, I would like to know which action is possible.
I should first check if I can accelerate, then idle, finally decelerate. I can also try to change lanes but with
caution and not too frequently.
- I want to know if I can accelerate, so I need to observe the car in front of me on the current lane, which is car
`176`. The distance between me and car `176` is 464.26 - 432.15 = 32.11 m, and the difference in speed is 20.98 -
24.00 = -3.02 m/s. Car `176` is traveling 32.11 m ahead of me and its speed is 3.02 m/s slower than mine. This
distance is safe and my speed is already higher than the front car on the current lane. So I should not accelerate.
- Since I cannot accelerate, I want to know if I can maintain my current speed. I need to observe the car in front
of me on the current lane, which is car `176`. Due to above calculation, the distance between me and car `176` is
32.11 m, and the difference in speed is -3.02 m/s. The distance 32.11 m is larger than my preferred car following
distance 30 m, and my speed is higher than the front car on the current lane. So I can maintain my current speed.
Great, I can make my decision now. Decision: IDLE

I have 5 actions to choose from. Now, I would like to know which action is possible.
I should first check if I can accelerate, then idle, finally decelerate. I can also try to change lanes but with
caution and not too frequently.
- I want to know if I can accelerate, so I need to observe the car in front of me on the current lane, which is car
`952`. The distance between me and car `952` is 422.15 - 399.89 = 22.26 m, and the difference in speed is 14.08 -
24.03 = -9.95 m/s. Car `952` is traveling 22.26 m ahead of me and its speed is 9.95 m/s slower than mine. This
distance is safe and my speed is already higher than the front car on the current lane. So I should not accelerate.
- Since I cannot accelerate, I want to know if I can idle. I need to observe the car behind me on the current lane,
which is car `776`. The distance between me and car `776` is 399.89 - 411.68 = -11.79 m, and the difference in speed
is 24.03 - 23.90 = 0.13 m/s. Car `776` is traveling 11.79 m behind me and its speed is 0.13 m/s slower than mine.
This distance is too close and my speed is already higher than the rear car on the current lane. If I idle, the
distance between me and car `776` will be further smaller, so I should not idle.
- In order to keep a safe distance with the rear car, I can only decelerate. Deceleration is a feasible action.
Great, I can make my decision now. Decision: Deceleration

- I want to know if I can accelerate, so I need to observe the car in front of me on the current lane, which is car
`464`. The distance between me and car `464` is 532.46 - 464.36 = 68.10 m, and the difference in speed is 22.10 -
24.00 = -1.90 m/s. Car `464` is traveling 68.10 m ahead of me and its speed is 1.90 m/s slower than mine. This

Figure 10: The prompts template for reflection module. The prompts in the grey box are fixed, while
the prompts in the coloured box are different depending on the current scenario.
Reflection prompts Figure 10 presents the template for the reflection module’s prompts, primarily
comprising two sections: system prompts and reflection prompts. The system prompts section is
entirely fixed and mainly consists of an introduction to the reflection task, along with instructions
and formatting requirements for LLM responses. On the other hand, the reflection prompts section
includes the scenario description of the erroneous decision and the faulty reasoning process made by
the LLM. We require the reflection module to produce three components: an error analysis, corrected
reasoning and decision-making, and suggestions on how to avoid making the same mistake in the
future.

CASE STUDY
In this section, let’s demonstrate several case studies.
First, we present the results of the reasoning module for three cases, as shown in Figure 11. In Case
1, the green ego car is closely following the car 368 in front, and their speeds are similar. Initially,
the driver agent explores whether it can accelerate in the current lane. The agent determines that,
since the ego car’s speed is similar to the car in front, there’s no need to accelerate. Subsequently, the
driver agent explores the possibility of maintaining the current speed. Through reasoning, the agent
concludes that although the distance between the vehicles is slightly shorter than the ideal following
distance, it’s safe to maintain the speed because the ego car’s speed is slightly lower than that of the
car in front. Lastly, the agent verifies the feasibility of changing lanes to the right and calculates
that the ego car’s speed is lower than the car in the right lane by 5.88 m/s, with a safe following
distance. Therefore, changing lanes to the right is also safe. In the end, the agent decides to change
lanes to the right. In Case 2, the scenario is relatively simple. The agent observes a long distance
with the car in front and that the ego car’s speed is lower than that car. Consequently, it decides to
accelerate. In this case, the agent does not perform further calculations regarding maintaining speed
or changing lanes, aligning with the typical thought process and reasoning of human drivers. In
Case 3, we changed the driving intention in the prompts from the default to “I need to change to the
rightmost lane.” The driver agent recognizes this intent. Although it determines that it can maintain
speed in the current lane, it continues to evaluate whether changing lanes to the right in the current
lane is feasible. Ultimately, considering the intention, the agent chooses to change lanes to the right
over maintaining speed.

Case 1
Reasoning and Decision
I have 5 actions to choose from. Now, I would like to know which action is possible.
I should first check if I can accelerate, then idle, finally decelerate. I can also try to change lanes but with
caution and not too frequently.
- I want to know if I can accelerate, so I need to observe the car in front of me on the current lane, which is
car `368`. The distance between me and car `368` is 558.08 - 528.53 = 29.55 m, and the difference in speed is
16.29 - 16.02 = 0.27 m/s. Car `368` is traveling 29.55 m ahead of me and its speed is 1.27 m/s faster than mine.
This distance is safe and my speed is similar the front car on the current lane. So I should not accelerate.
- Since I cannot accelerate, I want to know if I can maintain my current speed. I need to observe the car in
front of me on the current lane, which is car `368`. Due to above calculation, the distance between me and car
`368` is 29.55 m, and the difference in speed is 0.27 m/s. The distance 29.55 m is larger than my preferred car
following distance 30 m, but my speed is a bit lower than the front car on the current lane. So I can maintain
my current speed.
- I can try to change lanes to the right, but I need to check if it is safe. I need to observe the car on the
lane to my right, which is car `568`. The distance between me and car `568` is 541.40 - 528.53 = 12.87 m, and
the difference in speed is 21.90 - 16.02 = 5.88 m/s. Car `568` is traveling 12.87 m ahead of me and its speed is
5.88 m/s faster than mine. This distance is safe and my speed is lower than the front car on the right lane. So
I can change lanes to the right.

- I want to know if I can accelerate, so I need to observe the car in front of me on the current lane, which is
car `696`. The distance between me and car `696` is 817.67 - 773.04 = 44.63 m, and the difference in speed is
17.15 - 16.00 = 1.15 m/s. Car `696` is traveling 44.63 m ahead of me and its speed is 1.15 m/s faster than mine.
This distance is safe and my speed is already lower than the front car on the current lane. So I can accelerate.

Case 3
Reasoning and Decision
Based on the current scenario and the driving intentions, I will consider the available actions and refer to the
previous successful examples to make a decision.
- I want to know if I can accelerate, so I need to observe the car in front of me on the current lane, which is
car `424`. The distance between me and car `424` is 446.37 - 393.03 = 53.34 m, and the difference in speed is
21.28 - 25.21 = -3.93 m/s. Car `424` is traveling 53.34 m ahead of me and its speed is 3.93 m/s slower than
mine. This distance is safe and my speed is already higher than the front car on the current lane. So I should
not accelerate.
- Since I cannot accelerate, I want to know if I can idle. I need to observe the car in front of me on the
current lane, which is car `424`. Due to the above calculation, the distance between me and car `424` is 53.34
m, and the difference in speed is -3.93 m/s. The distance 53.34 m is higher than my preferred car following
distance 30 m, and my speed is higher than the front car on the current lane. So I can idle.
- Now, I need to consider my driving intention to change to the right lane. I should check the distance and
speed of the cars on the right lane. The car on the right lane ahead of me is car `280`. The distance between me
and car `280` is 429.23 - 393.03 = 36.20 m, and the difference in speed is 17.59 - 25.21 = -7.62 m/s. Car `280`
is traveling 36.20 m ahead of me and its speed is 7.62 m/s slower than mine. This distance is safe and my speed
is higher than the front car on the right lane. Therefore, it is safe to change to the right lane.
- Considering the above analysis and the driving intention, I can make my decision now.
Decision: Turn-right
Driving intention: I need change to the rightmost lane to get off highway.

Original Decision
Based on the given scenario, let's analyze the situation and make the best driving decision.
- First, let's consider accelerating. The vehicle `128` is ahead of me in my current lane. It is at
position 531.70 m, which is quite far from my current position of 480.91 m. The difference in speed
between us is 18.19 - 19.34 = -1.15 m/s. Since the vehicle is far ahead and its speed is slower
than mine, accelerating would only increase the speed difference and potentially lead to
a collision. Therefore, accelerating is not a suitable option.
- Next, let's consider maintaining our current speed. The vehicle `128` is ahead of me in my
current lane, and its speed is slightly slower than mine. If I maintain my current speed, I
will gradually catch up to it, which may result in a collision. Therefore, maintaining my current
speed is not a feasible option.
- Now, let's consider changing lanes. The vehicle on the right lane, `408`, is ahead of me. It is
at position 481.25 m, which is relatively close to my current position of 480.91 m. The
difference in speed between us is 17.82 - 19.34 = -1.52 m/s. The distance between us is
appropriate, and its speed is slower than mine. Therefore, changing lanes to the right seems like a
feasible plan to avoid a potential collision.
Based on the analysis, the best driving decision in this scenario is to change lanes to the right.
Decision: Turn-right

Crash Analyze
The mistake in ChatGPT's reasoning lies in its
assessment of the feasibility of changing lanes to
the right. It chose to change lanes to the right
based on the slower speed of the vehicle (`408`) in
the right lane and the distance between the two
vehicles. However, it did not consider the relative
position and speed of the vehicle in the right lane,
which is crucial for safe lane changing. The vehicle
in the right lane is only slightly ahead and moving
slower, which means there's a high risk of collision
if a lane change is attempted.
Lesson Learned
ChatGPT should consider not only the
speed and distance of other vehicles but
also their relative positioning when
making decisions about lane changes.
It's important to ensure that there's
enough space and time to safely complete
the lane change without causing
a collision. This might involve more
complex calculations of relative speed,
distance, and time.
Revised Decision
Based on the given scenario, let's analyze the situation and make the best driving decision.
- First, let's consider accelerating. The vehicle `128` is ahead of me in my current lane. It is at
position 531.70 m, which is quite far from my current position of 480.91 m. The difference in speed
between us is 18.19 - 19.34 = -1.15 m/s. Since the vehicle is far ahead and its speed is slower
than mine, accelerating would only increase the speed difference and potentially lead to a
collision. Therefore, accelerating is not a suitable option.
- Next, let's consider maintaining our current speed. The vehicle `128` is ahead of me in my
current lane, and its speed is slightly slower than mine. If I maintain my current speed, I will
gradually catch up to it, which may result in a collision. Therefore, maintaining my current speed
is not a feasible option.
- Now, let's consider changing lanes. The vehicle on the right lane, `408`, is ahead of me. It is
at position 481.25 m, which is relatively close to my current position of 480.91 m. The difference
in speed between us is 17.82 - 19.34 = -1.52 m/s. The distance between us is 481.25 - 480.91 = 0.34
m. Given the relative speed, the time to collision would be 0.34 / 1.52 = 0.22 seconds, which is
too short to safely change lanes. Therefore, changing lanes to the right is not a feasible plan. 
Given these considerations, the safest course of action would be to decelerate, which would
increase the distance between us and the vehicle ahead in the same lane, reducing the risk of
collision. 
Decision: Decelerate

Next, in Figure 12, we present a result of the reflection module. In this case, the ego car is traveling
in the second right lane and made the incorrect decision to change lanes to the right, resulting in
a collision with car 408. Consequently, the reflection module intervenes to correct the mistake.
First, it conducts an analysis of the cause of the collision. Upon reviewing the original reasoning
process, GPT-4 astutely identifies the source of the error. It realizes that the initial decision did not
take into account the relative distance between the vehicles in the right lane. In fact, car 408 was
merely “slightly ahead” of the ego car, contrary to what the initial decision process described as an
“appropriate” distance. Subsequently, in the revised decision process, the driver agent supplements
and correctly calculates the relative position of the ego car and the car in the right lane. It also
includes the calculation of “time to collision” (which was completely absent in the original decision).
Based on this calculation, it determines that “time to collision is too short to safely change lanes.” As
a result, it chooses to decelerate, avoiding the collision. Finally, the reflection module summarizes
the lesson learned from this error, emphasizing the importance of ensuring that there is enough space
and time to safely complete a lane change without causing a collision: “It’s important to ensure that
there’s enough space and time to safely complete the lane change without causing a collision.”

TRAINING SETTINGS OF GRAD
Figure 13: Rewards for each episode are evaluated during the training process. Each data point
represents the average of 5 independent runs and has been smoothed using a window size of 9. The
shadows correspond to the standard deviations of these runs.
Here we introduce the training settings of the RL method GRAD for the comparing with the DiLu.
The rewards for each episode of GRAD are evaluated during the training process as shown in Fig-
ure 13. During the training, We set the Observations consisting of the kinematic status of the agent
and the surrounding vehicles, specifically their coordinates, velocity, and heading. The maximum
number of surrounding vehicles that can be observed is 32, and their speeds range from 15 to 25
units. As for the Action, it is discrete and comprises the following options: OneLaneLeft, Idle,
OneLaneRight, SpeedLevelUp, and SpeedLevelDown. The available speed levels are 10, 15, 20, 25,
and 32 units. The reward system includes two components, one is that a reward of 0.2 is granted for
each time step survived by the agent, and the other one is that the reward is linearly mapped from
the driving speed (10, 32), a reward value between 0 and 0.8. Moreover, Each model is trained for
600,000 action steps and is subsequently evaluated over 24 episodes using deterministic policies.

DIFFERENT DENSITY LEVEL
In order to give the reader an intuitive understanding of the different vehicle densities under
Highway-env, we show in Figure 14 screenshots of a number of scenarios for the experimental part
of this paper for three different traffic densities. It can be seen that with increasing vehicle density,
there are more vehicles in the scenario, and the vehicle spacing and vehicle speed are reduced.
